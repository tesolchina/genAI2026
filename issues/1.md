## 🎓 Student Ambassador Program

This program highlights the transformative power of GitHub Copilot Agent, which distinguishes itself from traditional AI chat interfaces by integrating directly into IDEs. This allows students to engage with AI in real coding environments, making it an interactive learning tool and a game-changer for development tasks. We also introduce an Ambassador Program to train and support students in exploring this technology and sharing their experiences within their communities.
