## Appendix – Article A

**Supporting schools to use face recognition systems: a continuance intention perspective of elementary school parents in China**  
Jon-Chao Hong, Yushun Li, Shuo-Ying Kuo, Xin An  
2022

### Abstract

A great deal of attention has been focused on technological innovation, for example, face recognition, which has been used in some countries in various fields. Nonetheless, there has been little attention paid to parents' acceptance of the use of face recognition systems on campus. To address this gap in the literature, this study examined how different degrees of technological innovativeness<sup>1</sup> and dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW)<sup>2</sup> influence parents' perceived value<sup>3</sup> of using and intention to continue supporting schools' use of face recognition systems. This study adopted snowball sampling<sup>4</sup> to collect data through questionnaires, and received 380 valid responses from parents living in Xuzhou, China. Confirmatory factor analysis<sup>5</sup> and structural equation modelling<sup>6</sup> were used to analyse the data, with results indicating that: (1) DBVW was negatively related to perceived value; (2) technological innovativeness was positively related to perceived value; and (3) perceived value was positively related to continuance intention<sup>7</sup> to use face recognition systems. The results suggest that parents support the use of face recognition systems in elementary schools; thus, such systems can be adopted by other elementary schools in other areas.

### Discussion

Although implicit and explicit attitudes are different, they can both affect behaviours, and individuals' attitude can promote the value perception before performing a behaviour (Kaiser et al., 2021). In line with this, the present study explored parents' DBVW and technological innovativeness in the value perception of the use of face-recognition systems, and continuous intention to use such systems as a research framework. The results indicate that the average score of parents' DBVW is 3.865, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parents were worried about the disclosure of students' personal privacy, and generally had a cautious attitude towards new technologies (Perry & Sibley, 2010). The average score of parents' technological innovativeness is 3.796, which is higher than the average level (3.000), indicating that the parent respondents<sup>8</sup> tended to accept new technology (Wang & Lee, 2020). The average score of parents' perceived value is 3.919, which is much higher than the neutral level (3.000), indicating that the parents generally recognize the value of face recognition systems (Kim et al., 2007). The average score of CIU is 3.776, which is higher than the neutral level (3.000), indicating that the respondents generally preferred to continue using the face recognition system at the campus entrance. On the whole, although the parent respondents thought that the face recognition system had certain risks, they were willing to try technological innovation and they thought the system was valuable, so they intended to continue using it.

According to the results of the path analysis coefficient test, the DBVW was negatively correlated with perceived value, supporting H1(DBVW is negatively related to perceived value), which is consistent with previous studies (Dhaggara et al., 2020). The results of this study indicate that there was a significant negative correlation between users' anxiety about face recognition technology and their perceived usefulness. When users could trust that they had information security on the Internet, they would have lower information leakage anxiety and higher use intention (Singh & Sinha, 2020). Therefore, this study suggests that the higher the parents' DBVW, the lower the value they perceived.

The results of the path analysis coefficient test revealed that technological innovativeness has a positive correlation with perceived value, supporting H2(Technological innovativeness was positively related to perceived value). The results are consistent with previous studies (Albertsen et al., 2020; Lee, 2013), which proved that personal innovation had a positive relationship with perceived usefulness which accounts for the relationship between parents' technological innovativeness and perceived value in this research. This study found that the higher the technological innovativeness, the higher the perceived value.

## Appendix – Article B

**Facial recognition technology in schools: critical questions and concerns**  
Mark Andrejevic & Neil Selwyn  
2020

### Abstract

Facial recognition technology is now being introduced across various aspects of public life. This includes the burgeoning<sup>1</sup> integration of facial recognition and facial detection into compulsory<sup>2</sup> schooling to address issues such as campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection. So far, these technologies have largely been seen as routine additions to school systems with already extensive cultures of monitoring and surveillance<sup>3</sup>. While critical commentators are beginning to question the pedagogical<sup>4</sup> limitations of facially driven<sup>5</sup> learning, this article contends that school-based facial recognition presents a number of other social challenges and concerns that merit specific attention. This includes the likelihood of facial recognition technology altering the nature of schools and schooling along divisive<sup>6</sup>, authoritarian<sup>7</sup> and oppressive lines. Against this background, the article considers whether or not a valid case can ever be made for allowing this form of technology in schools.

### Discussion – Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools

These questions over diminished notions of pedagogy and consent<sup>8</sup> are important. Yet, at this point, we would like to argue that there are a number of additional issues and concerns that cast further serious doubt upon the implementation of facial recognition technologies in schools. In brief, the following points of contention<sup>9</sup> might be raised:

**The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition**

Another point of concern is the inescapability<sup>10</sup> of facial monitoring within school contexts. Unlike other forms of personal data (i.e., any piece of data connected to an individual's name), facial data lends itself to constant and permanent surveillance. In short, people are always connected to their faces. Thus, unlike social media posts or interactions with school learning management systems, there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they 'share'. While students might be able to opt-out<sup>11</sup> from facial detection elements of their school's learning systems (for example, the use of eye-tracking or facial thermal imaging for learning analytics), there is no right to decline to participate in 'non-cooperative' facial recognition systems (indeed, any opt-out effectively renders campus facial recognition systems ineffective). While such coercion<sup>12</sup> applies to the use of facial recognition in all public spaces, it is especially acute in schools. For example, most schools enforce dress codes that preclude students' faces being covered by hair, hoods or other obtrusions<sup>13</sup>. This makes it difficult for students to obscure their faces from surveillance cameras. This also raises the inadequacy of any promise of 'informed consent<sup>14</sup>' regarding school facial recognition systems. The systems being deployed in schools for security and attendance purposes rely on complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors in order to operate. This renders 'opt-in<sup>15</sup>' and 'opt-out' approaches counter-productive from the point of view of the system provider. Even if opt-out protocols<sup>16</sup> are in place, the system has to scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out.

### Sample Academic Writing Quiz Script – Student A

Facial recognition technology (FRT) is increasingly incorporated in schools, aiming to improve functions like security. This summary reports key arguments for and against the adoption of FRT in schools, from the perspectives of parents' perceptions on the technology and privacy concerns about students.

The debate surrounding facial recognition in schools is fundamentally a conflict over its potential benefits brought to schools in the areas of safety versus its potential to infringe upon privacy and normalise surveillance (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020; Hong et al., 2022). On one hand, scholars like Hong et al. (2022) point out that, despite awareness of privacy issues, parents still support the continued use of FRT in schools as they prioritise its practical value and innovative features over potential risks. Conversely, others like Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) caution that the same technology poses serious social and ethical risks by potentially shifting schools toward authoritarian environments. They contend that it creates constant, inescapable surveillance that students cannot avoid, violating students' consent. This makes a loss of privacy seem normal and can lead to pressure and control.

While facial recognition is perceived as worthwhile by certain stakeholders, concerns about surveillance without students' consent highlight its controversial nature in educational settings.

### Sample Academic Writing Quiz Script – Student B

Facial recognition technology is used more and more in schools all over the world. It helps with things like school security and checking students in automatically. In China, parents have different opinions about this technology. Some support it, but others worry about its effects. These articles talk about facial recognition in schools and show some of the good and bad sides of it (Hong et al., 2022; Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).

Article A says that many parents support facial recognition technology in elementary schools because they think it is useful and trustworthy. According to the research findings, the average score of parents' perceived value is 3.919, which is much higher than the neutral level (3.000). The study shows parents gave high scores for how much value they see in the system and want to keep using it. Even though some parents worry about privacy, they still accept the technology, maybe because they believe it will make schools safer or easier to manage (Hong et al., 2022).

Article B says facial recognition is bad because there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they share. Students don't have freedom to choose to opt out. Maybe students don't care, or it is not a big problem. The technology might just help schools be more organized (Andrejevic & Selwyn).

So, I think that Article A says parents like facial recognition because of its value, but Article B warns about problems and control, showing it is a debated issue (Hong et al., 2022; Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
