# Week 6 — Plans

- **`plan_week6_H1_AWQ_prep.md`** — **Week 6 Hour 1 only**: **5 tasks** for **AWQ final prep & practice** before the **in-class Academic Writing Quiz (AWQ)**.
  - **Task 1:** AWQ rubric checklist (Summary Accuracy, Synthesis, Paraphrasing, Tone, Citations).
  - **Task 2:** Quick practice — thesis + one synthesis sentence.
  - **Task 3:** Common errors recap (bias, “this passage,” APA, weak verbs).
  - **Task 4:** Timed mini-practice — intro only or plan only (8–10 min).
  - **Task 5:** Logistical prep for in-class AWQ (when/where, what to bring, rules) + buffer.

**Goal:** Reinforce AWQ skills, run a short timed practice, and ensure students are ready for the **in-class AWQ** (same or later session in Week 6).

**Materials:** Sample AWQ (Articles A & B, Student A), AWQ instructions, rubric. Week 5 plan (`plan_week5_AWQ_argumentation.md`) for prior AWQ + argumentation practice.
