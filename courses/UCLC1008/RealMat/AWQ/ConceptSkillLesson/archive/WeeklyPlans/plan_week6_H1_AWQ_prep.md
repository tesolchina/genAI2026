# Week 6 — Hour 1 Plan: AWQ Final Prep & Practice (Before In-Class Quiz)

**Scope:** **Week 6 Hour 1 only** — **5 tasks**. The **Academic Writing Quiz (AWQ)** is **in-class** in Week 6; this hour focuses on **final AWQ prep and practice** before the quiz.

**Focus:** Rubric checklist, quick practice (thesis + synthesis), common errors recap, timed mini-practice, logistical prep for the in-class AWQ. Optionally **one** short argumentation recap if time allows.

**Materials:**
- **Sample AWQ / Articles A & B / Student A:** `lessonsMoodle/Mat/UCLC1008_2526a_Sample_AWQ_Student.md`
- **AWQ instructions** (in Sample AWQ): ≤300 words; 60 min; intro (background + thesis), body (topic sentences), conclusion; APA citations; no own views; no copying.
- **AWQ rubric:** Summary Accuracy (20%), Synthesis (20%), Paraphrasing (20%), Academic Tone & Clarity (20%), In-text Citations (20%).
- **Module 2 & 3:** Synthesis, paraphrasing, argumentation (as recap only if needed).

**Format per task:** **Input** (~1 min) → **Demo** (30–45 s) → **MC** (1 min) → **Speaking** (1 min) → **Writing** (handout / Moodle) → **Feedback** (2 min).  
**Timing:** ~5–6 min per task. Leave buffer for **logistics** (where/when the in-class AWQ will run, what to bring, what to expect).

## Week 6 — Hour 1 (5 tasks) — AWQ final prep & practice

**Goal:** Reinforce key AWQ skills, run a short timed practice, and ensure students are ready for the **in-class AWQ** (same or later session in Week 6).

---

### Task 1: AWQ rubric checklist — Summary Accuracy, Synthesis, Paraphrasing, Tone, Citations (**AWQ**)

**Rubric:** All AWQ criteria.

**Input (~1 min):**  
**Checklist:** (1) **Summary Accuracy** — main ideas from both articles; no omission; no bias; no distortion. (2) **Synthesis** — both sources in one paragraph (or more); comparison/contrast; linkers. (3) **Paraphrasing** — own words; no copying. (4) **Academic Tone & Clarity** — thesis; topic sentences; conclusion. (5) **In-text Citations** — APA; both sources; signal phrases / author-prominent / information-prominent.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Walk through the rubric; tick each criterion against a model sentence or short paragraph (e.g. from Student A).

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which rubric criterion is about **weaving both sources** and showing a relationship?*  
A) Summary Accuracy.  
B) Synthesis.  
C) Paraphrasing.  
D) In-text Citations only.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “For each of the five criteria, name one thing you must do and one thing you must avoid.”

**Writing (handout / Moodle):** Fill in a **rubric checklist** (five criteria; 1–2 “Do” and 1 “Avoid” per criterion). Exchange with a partner; add one suggestion. Post your checklist (or a photo). Reply to one peer: Clear? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Synthesis = both sources + relationship (e.g. contrast, comparison).

---

### Task 2: Quick practice — thesis + one synthesis sentence (**AWQ**)

**Rubric:** Academic Tone & Clarity; Synthesis.

**Input (~1 min):**  
**Task:** Write (1) **one thesis sentence** for the Sample AWQ (topic + both sources + main themes), and (2) **one synthesis sentence** that weaves a point from Article A and one from Article B using “In contrast,” “Whereas,” or “However.” Cite both.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show one strong thesis + one strong synthesis sentence from Student A or board.

**MC (1 min):**  
*What should the **thesis** include?*  
A) Only your opinion.  
B) Topic + both articles (authors/years) + main themes (e.g. support vs concerns).  
C) Only Article A.  
D) Word count.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Read your thesis and synthesis sentence aloud. Does the thesis name both sources and themes?”

**Writing (Moodle / handout):** Post **thesis** (1 sentence) + **synthesis sentence** (1 sentence, both sources, one linker). Reply to one peer: Thesis = roadmap? Synthesis = both sources + relationship? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Thesis = topic + both sources + themes; synthesis = both + link.

---

### Task 3: Common errors recap — bias, “this passage,” APA, weak verbs (**Module 2**; revision plan)

**Rubric:** Summary Accuracy; Paraphrasing; In-text Citations; Academic Tone.

**Input (~1 min):**  
**Recap:** Avoid “I think,” “perhaps,” “in my view”; “According to this passage” (use author + year); “they talked about,” “mention” (use “argue,” “suggest,” “note”); near-copy; missing or wrong citation; “shows” with plural subject (use “show”).

**Demo (30–45 s):** Correct 2–3 flawed sentences on the board (bias, “this passage,” APA, verb).

**MC (1 min):**  
*What is wrong with “According to this passage, parents support FRT”?*  
A) Nothing.  
B) “This passage” is vague; use author(s) and year.  
C) No reporting verb.  
D) Too long.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Fix: ‘Andrejevic and Selwyn(2020) shows that FRT raises concerns.’”

**Writing (Moodle / handout):** Post **two** corrected versions: (1) “I think Article B is right about consent.” (2) “According to this passage, parents support FRT.” Reply to one peer: Corrections right? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Use “Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) state/argue that…”; “shows” → “show” (plural subject).

---

### Task 4: Timed mini-practice — intro only or plan only (**AWQ**)

**Rubric:** Academic Tone & Clarity; Summary Accuracy.

**Input (~1 min):**  
**Task:** **Timed** (e.g. **8–10 min**): Write **either** (a) the **full introduction** (background + authors + thesis) for the Sample AWQ, **or** (b) a **brief plan** (thesis + 2–3 body topic sentences + conclusion idea) for the full AWQ. Use Articles A & B.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Remind structure: background → authors + year → thesis. Or: thesis → body 1, body 2, (body 3) → conclusion.

**MC (1 min):**  
*In the AWQ, how long do you have?*  
A) 30 minutes.  
B) 45 minutes.  
C) 60 minutes.  
D) 90 minutes.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “After the timer: swap intros or plans. Does the thesis name both sources and themes?”

**Writing (handout):** Complete **timed** intro or plan. Submit on paper or post (e.g. photo). Peer swap; one **specific** compliment + one **specific** suggestion (rubric-linked). Reply to one peer: Useful feedback? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** C. 60 min for full AWQ; use this short timed slice to practise pace.

---

### Task 5: Logistical prep for in-class AWQ + buffer (**AWQ**)

**Rubric:** N/A — logistics and readiness.

**Input (~1 min):**  
**Logistics:** When and where is the **in-class AWQ**? What to bring (e.g. pen, paper, printed excerpts if allowed; or confirm computer lab / device). What **not** to use (no online tools, AI, dictionaries, paraphrasing apps). **Format:** ≤300 words; intro, body, conclusion; APA in-text citations only (no reference list). **Instructions:** Recap key points from Sample AWQ instructions (topic, two articles, no own views, no copying).

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show or distribute the **actual AWQ instruction sheet** (or a one-slide summary). Highlight timing, word limit, structure, and rubric.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Are you allowed to use online paraphrasing tools during the AWQ?*  
A) Yes.  
B) No.  
C) Only dictionaries.  
D) Only AI.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Anything unclear about the AWQ format, timing, or rules? Ask the teacher.”

**Writing (optional):** Post **one question** you still have about the AWQ (format, timing, rubric, or logistics). Teacher addresses FAQs before the quiz.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. No online or AI tools during the AWQ. Use remaining time for Q&A and buffer before the in-class quiz.
