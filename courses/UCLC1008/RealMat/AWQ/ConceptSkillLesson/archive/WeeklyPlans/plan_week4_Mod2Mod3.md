# Week 4 Plan: 10 Tasks — Synthesising First, Then Argumentation

**Scope:** Week 4 **Hour 1** (5 tasks) and **Hour 2** (5 tasks). **Hour 3** is **reserved for consultation** (no tasks).

**Sequence:** Cover **synthesising** (Module 2, Part 3) **first** in Hour 1. Then move to **argumentation** (Module 3) in Hour 2. Week 3 covered paraphrasing, summarising, no bias, and main-idea coverage; Week 4 builds on that with **synthesis** before introducing Toulmin, ACE, and rebuttals.

**Materials:**
- **Module 2:** `_lovable_submodule/materials/MD/UE1 (2526B) Module 2 (v1_20251214).md` — Part 3: Synthesising (what is synthesising, examples, Activity 3.1 Identifying synthesis, commonly used expressions, Activity 3.2 Common errors).
- **Module 3:** `_lovable_submodule/materials/MD/UE1 (2526B) Module 3 (v1_20260118_Teacher).md` — Argumentation models (Toulmin, ACE, rebuttal, counterargument strategies).
- **Module 3 PDF:** `_lovable_submodule/materials/UE1 (2526B) Teacher Folder/02 Teaching Materials/UE1 (2526B) Module 3 Teacher (v1_20260118_for comment).pdf`
- **Sample AWQ / Articles A & B:** `lessonsMoodle/Mat/UCLC1008_2526a_Sample_AWQ_Student.md` (Hong et al., Andrejevic & Selwyn; FRT in schools). Use **Student A** as model for synthesis.
- **Sample ACE:** Module 3, Part 3; use for ACE-structure tasks in Hour 2.

**Format per task:** **Input** (~1 min) → **Demo** (30–45 s) → **MC** (1 min) → **Speaking** (1 min) → **Writing** (Moodle or handout) → **Feedback** (2 min).  
**Timing:** ~5–6 min per task; buffer for intro, recap, and Moodle posting.

## Week 4 — Hour 1 (5 tasks) — Module 2: Synthesising

**Focus:** What is synthesising; integrating both sources; synthesis expressions; topic sentences for synthesis; thesis and conclusion for AWQ-style summary. Use **Sample AWQ**, **Articles A & B**, and **Student A** (Module 2, Week 3 plan).

**Goal:** Consolidate **synthesising** before moving to argumentation. Students learn to weave both sources, show agreement/contrast, and structure a synthesis paragraph (topic sentence, thesis, conclusion).

---

### Task 1: What is synthesising? (**Module 2**, Part 3 — What is Synthesising?)

**Rubric:** Synthesis — interweaving sources; comparison/contrast.

**Input (~1 min):**  
**Synthesising** = meaningfully **interweaving** ideas from **two or more sources** to form a cohesive argument or narrative. Present a clear logical flow: ideas **complement** or **contrast** with one another. Use **synthesis words** (e.g. “similarly,” “on the other hand,” “in contrast”) to highlight relationships. **Always cite** both sources.

**Examples (Module 2):** Combining *similar* ideas — “Similarly,” “as well as”; combining *contrasting* ideas — “However,” “In contrast.” Seng et al. vs Andrejevic & Selwyn on privacy vs security.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show one Module 2 example (similar + “Similarly”) and one (contrast + “However”). Underline synthesis words and citations.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which best describes synthesising?*  
A) Summarise Article A in one paragraph, Article B in the next, with no links.  
B) Interweave ideas from both sources in one paragraph, showing how they agree or contrast, and cite both.  
C) Copy one sentence from each article.  
D) Give your own opinion on both articles.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “How do Hong et al. and Andrejevic & Selwyn **differ** on FRT in schools? Say it in one sentence.”

**Writing (Moodle):** Post **one sentence** that **synthesises** a point from **Article A** and one from **Article B** (cite both), using **one** synthesis word (“Similarly,” “However,” “In contrast,” “Whereas”). Reply to one peer: Are both sources integrated? Relationship clear? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Interweave both sources; show agreement or contrast; cite both.

---

### Task 2: Synthesis — integrating both sources (**Module 2**, Part 3; Week 3 plan Task 11)

**Rubric:** Synthesis — integrates both excerpts; comparison/contrast.

**Input (~1 min):**  
Synthesis = **weave both sources** in one paragraph (or more); show a **relationship** (e.g. comparison, contrast). Avoid: “Article A says… Article B says…” in **separate blocks** with no linking.

**Example (Student A):** “The debate… is fundamentally a conflict over… benefits… versus… privacy and… surveillance (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020; Hong et al., 2022). On one hand, Hong et al. (2022)… Conversely, Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) caution…”

**Demo (30–45 s):** Underline “On one hand,” “Conversely,” and both citations. Emphasise: **both** sources + **relationship** (contrast).

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which best describes synthesis in the AWQ?*  
A) Summarise Article A in one paragraph, Article B in the next, no links.  
B) In one paragraph, compare or contrast main claims from both articles and cite both.  
C) Copy one sentence from each article.  
D) Give your own opinion on both articles.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “How do Hong et al. and Andrejevic & Selwyn **differ** on FRT in schools?” (one sentence)

**Writing (Moodle):** Write **one body-paragraph topic sentence** that sets up a comparison or contrast between Article A and Article B (use author names and year). Post it. Reply to one peer: Does it integrate both sources? Yes/No + reason.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. One paragraph, both sources, clear relationship (e.g. “whereas,” “in contrast,” “conversely”).

---

### Task 3: Synthesis expressions — “similarly,” “in contrast,” “on one hand” (**Module 2**, Commonly used expressions)

**Rubric:** Synthesis — effective linking; Academic Tone.

**Input (~1 min):**  
Use **synthesis words** to show **agreement** or **contrast**: “Similarly,” “On one hand … On the other,” “Conversely,” “In contrast,” “Whereas,” “While X…, Y…,” “However.”

**Examples (Module 2):** “Caines’s (2021) view is similar to McClellan’s (2020)…”; “McClellan (2020) focuses on… **whereas** Caines (2021) highlights….”; Seng et al. vs Andrejevic & Selwyn linked with “However.”

**Demo (30–45 s):** Insert one or two linkers into a two-source sentence; show how meaning becomes clearer.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which linking phrase best shows **contrast** between the two articles?*  
A) Similarly, both articles…  
B) In contrast, Hong et al. support FRT while Andrejevic and Selwyn raise concerns.  
C) In addition, Article B…  
D) First, Article A…

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Say one sentence that uses ‘Whereas’ or ‘While’ to contrast Article A and Article B.”

**Writing (Moodle):** Write **one sentence** that synthesises a point from Article A and one from Article B using **one** of: “In contrast,” “Whereas,” “While…, ….” Post it. Reply to one peer: Is the relationship clear? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. “In contrast” signals opposition between sources.

---

### Task 4: Topic sentences for synthesis (**Module 1 & 2**; Academic Tone; Week 3 plan Task 13)

**Rubric:** Academic Tone & Clarity — effective topic sentences; Synthesis.

**Input (~1 min):**  
Each body paragraph needs a **topic sentence** that states the paragraph’s main point and can **integrate both** sources (e.g. “The debate over FRT in schools centres on X versus Y (Author A, year; Author B, year).”).

Avoid: “Article A says… Article B says…” as topic sentences **without** a unifying claim.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Compare a weak topic sentence (“They talked about security”) with a stronger one that names both sources and the relationship.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is an effective topic sentence for a synthesis paragraph?*  
A) Article A is about parents. Article B is about surveillance.  
B) The debate over FRT in schools hinges on perceived benefits versus surveillance and consent (Hong et al., 2022; Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).  
C) I will compare two articles.  
D) Both articles are interesting.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Draft a topic sentence for a paragraph that contrasts parents’ support (A) and concerns about consent (B).”

**Writing (Moodle):** Post **one topic sentence** for a synthesis paragraph on FRT in schools (both articles, clear relationship). Reply to one peer: Does it preview the paragraph’s focus? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Topic sentence = unified claim + both sources + relationship.

---

### Task 5: Thesis and conclusion for AWQ (**Module 2**; Week 3 plan Tasks 14–15)

**Rubric:** Academic Tone & Clarity — clear thesis; Summary Accuracy — relevant conclusion.

**Input (~1 min):**  
- **Thesis** = **roadmap** of the summary: **topic**, **which sources**, **main themes** (e.g. support vs concerns). No “I” or “we”; no “I will summarise.”  
- **Conclusion** = **recap** main points (e.g. support vs concerns); **attribute** to sources; **no new claims** or “I think.” Avoid: structure-only (“The article has an intro and body”); personal take (“We must decide”); vague (“FRT is complex”).

**Example – Effective thesis:** “This summary reports key arguments for and against the adoption of FRT in schools, from the perspectives of parents’ perceptions and privacy concerns about students.”  
**Example – Effective conclusion (Student A):** “While facial recognition is perceived as worthwhile by certain stakeholders, concerns about surveillance without students’ consent highlight its controversial nature in educational settings.”

**Demo (30–45 s):** Highlight “reports,” “for and against,” “parents’ perceptions,” “privacy concerns” in thesis; recap + attribution in conclusion.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is an effective **thesis** for this AWQ summary?*  
A) I will summarise two articles about face recognition.  
B) This essay discusses Hong et al. and Andrejevic and Selwyn.  
C) The summary presents key arguments for and against FRT in schools, including parents’ support and concerns about surveillance and consent.  
D) Face recognition is good and bad.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “What should a conclusion include? What should it avoid?”

**Writing (Moodle):** Write **one thesis statement** (1–2 sentences) for the Sample AWQ that (1) names the topic, (2) signals both articles, (3) previews main themes. Then write **one conclusion sentence** that recaps support vs concerns and attributes to the sources. Post both. Reply to one peer: Thesis = roadmap? Conclusion = recap + attribution? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** C. Thesis = topic + both sources + overview; conclusion = recap + attribution + no personal view or structure-only.

---

## Week 4 — Hour 2 (5 tasks) — Module 3: Argumentation

**Focus:** What constitutes an argument; Toulmin (Claim, Grounds, Warrant); linking evidence to claims (common errors); rebuttal (counterargument + response); ACE structure; conclusion for argumentative writing.

**Goal:** Build on **synthesising** (Hour 1) by moving to **argumentation** — making and supporting your own claims, using sources as evidence, and responding to counterarguments. Use Module 3, Sample ACE, and Articles A & B where relevant.

---

### Task 6: What constitutes an argument? — Evidence, explanation, claim (**Module 3**, Part 1; Activities 1.1–1.2)

**Rubric:** Argument structure; clarity of reasoning.

**Input (~1 min):**  
An **argument** needs (1) **Evidence** (Grounds) — data, facts, citations; (2) **Explanation** (Warrant) — how the evidence supports the claim; (3) **Claim** — the debatable assertion or thesis.

Use a short example (e.g. Module 3 Instagram post on chatbots, or “Dogs are the greatest pets” + evidence + explanation).

**Demo (30–45 s):** Identify evidence vs explanation vs claim in the example. Stress: **claim** = debatable assertion; **evidence** = data/fact; **explanation** = logical link.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is a **claim** rather than evidence?*  
A) Chatbot users interact 30% less with humans.  
B) Chatbots cannot be a true friend to young people.  
C) The study sampled 500 users.  
D) Participants were aged 18–25.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Identify one **claim**, one **evidence**, and one **explanation** in the example.”

**Writing (Moodle):** Post **one sentence** that states a **claim** about FRT in schools or chatbots, and **one sentence** that could serve as **evidence** for it. Reply to one peer: Is the link clear? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Claim = debatable assertion; A/C/D = evidence or context.

---

### Task 7: Toulmin overview — Claim, Grounds, Warrant (**Module 3**, Part 2; Activities 2.1–2.2)

**Rubric:** Logical structure; linking evidence to claims.

**Input (~1 min):**  
**Claim** = main assertion. **Grounds** = evidence (facts, data, citations). **Warrant** = explanation that connects grounds to claim (make it explicit in academic writing).

**Example (Module 3):** Claim — “FRT in schools removes students’ capacity to maintain anonymity.” Grounds — facial data enables constant surveillance; students cannot opt out. Warrant — young people are given no choice in what facial data is gathered.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show the FRT “inescapability” or dogs/chatbot example. Underline claim, grounds, warrant.

**MC (1 min):**  
*What is the **warrant**?*  
A) The main assertion (e.g. “FRT undermines consent”).  
B) The data or facts cited.  
C) The explanation linking evidence to the claim.  
D) The counterargument.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Given the claim ‘Chatbots reduce loneliness,’ what could serve as grounds? What would the warrant need to say?”

**Writing (Moodle):** Given **claim**: “FRT in schools exacerbates racial discrimination.” **Grounds**: FRT arbitrarily divides populations via race/gender; systems fail to accurately recognise non-white faces (Andrejevic & Selwyn). Post **one sentence** that acts as the **warrant** (explanation linking grounds to claim). Reply to one peer: Does it logically connect? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** C. Warrant = connective tissue between grounds and claim.

---

### Task 8: Linking evidence to claims — avoid common errors (**Module 3**, Activity 2.4)

**Rubric:** Logical clarity; relevance of explanation to evidence and claim.

**Input (~1 min):**  
Common errors: (1) **Unclear link** — explanation doesn’t show how evidence supports the claim. (2) **Poor reasoning** — exaggerated or oversimplified. (3) **Misaligning** — explanation introduces ideas not in the evidence.

**Example (Module 3):** Claim — “Chatbots improve efficiency by reducing unnecessary human interaction.” Evidence — “Chatbot users interact 30% less with humans.” Bad explanation — “People who use chatbots prefer technology over humans” (no link to efficiency). Better — “Reducing human interactions allows users to resolve queries faster, saving time for other tasks.”

**Demo (30–45 s):** Compare one weak vs one revised explanation from Module 3.

**MC (1 min):**  
*What is wrong with this explanation? Claim: “Chatbots create social isolation.” Evidence: “Users interact 30% less with humans.” Explanation: “Many people feel lonely when using technology frequently.”*  
A) Nothing.  
B) It doesn’t show how reduced interaction **specifically** leads to isolation; it only states a general correlation.  
C) The evidence is wrong.  
D) The claim is wrong.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Revise the explanation so it clearly links reduced interaction → isolation.”

**Writing (Moodle):** **Claim:** “Chatbots improve workplace productivity by minimising interruptions.” **Evidence:** “Chatbot users interact 30% less with humans.” **Weak explanation:** “Less talking means more work gets done.” Post a **revised explanation** (1–2 sentences) that properly links evidence to claim. Reply to one peer: Clear link? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Explanation must explicitly connect evidence to claim; avoid oversimplification.

---

### Task 9: Rebuttal — counterargument + response (**Module 3**, Activity 2.5, 2.6)

**Rubric:** Rebuttal structure; balance and credibility.

**Input (~1 min):**  
**Rebuttal** = **Counterargument** (opposing view that challenges your claim) + **Response** (your answer to that challenge). Acknowledging the other side strengthens your argument.

**Example (Module 3):** Claim — “Chatbots cannot be a true friend.” Counterargument — “Users can ask chatbots to challenge them.” Response — “That relies on user initiation; it’s not equivalent to the organic pushback of a real friend.”

**Demo (30–45 s):** Highlight counterargument vs response in the Module 3 example.

**MC (1 min):**  
*What is the **response** in a rebuttal?*  
A) The opposite view you cite.  
B) Your answer to the counterargument, defending or refining your claim.  
C) Your main claim.  
D) The evidence.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “For the claim ‘FRT in schools undermines consent,’ suggest one counterargument and one response.”

**Writing (Moodle):** Given **claim**: “FRT in schools undermines students’ consent.” Post **one sentence** as **counterargument** and **one sentence** as **response**. Reply to one peer: Does the response address the counterargument? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Response = your reply to the counterargument.

---

### Task 10: ACE structure & conclusion for argumentative writing (**Module 3**, Part 3; Module 2)

**Rubric:** Argument structure; ACE requirements; conclusion quality.

**Input (~1 min):**  
- **ACE structure:** **ACE Draft** — one argument, one claim, one grounds, one warrant, one rebuttal. **ACE Final** — one argument, **two** claims, two grounds, two warrants, two rebuttals.  
- **Conclusion for argumentative writing:** **Recap** your main argument (and rebuttal); **attribute** to sources; **no new claims** or “I think.” Different from **AWQ** (recap both articles): here you recap **your** argument and your response to the counterargument.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Sketch one mini-argument (one claim, grounds, warrant, rebuttal) using Module 3 or Sample ACE. Compare weak vs strong conclusion.

**MC (1 min):**  
*In the ACE Draft, how many **claims** do you need?*  
A) Zero.  
B) One.  
C) Three.  
D) As many as you want.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Outline one mini-argument on FRT or chatbots: claim, grounds, warrant, rebuttal. What should the conclusion include?”

**Writing (Moodle):** Post an **outline** for **one** mini-argument (one claim, one grounds, one warrant, one rebuttal) on **FRT in schools** or **chatbots**. Then write **one conclusion sentence** (or two) that recaps your claim + rebuttal and attributes to sources. Reply to one peer: All four elements present? Conclusion appropriate? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. ACE Draft = one claim (plus grounds, warrant, rebuttal). Conclusion = recap + attribution + no new claims.

---

## Week 4 — Hour 3: Consultation

**No tasks.** Reserved for:

- Q&A on **synthesising** (Module 2) and **argumentation** (Module 3, Toulmin, ACE, rebuttals).
- Support for **AWQ** summary (synthesis) or **ACE Draft** (argumentative) assignments.
- Individual or small-group consultation; clarify tasks 1–10 if needed.
