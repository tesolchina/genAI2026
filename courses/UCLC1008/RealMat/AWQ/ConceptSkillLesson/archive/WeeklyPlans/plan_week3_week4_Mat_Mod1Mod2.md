### Task 1: Title analysis — subject, context, stance (**Module 1**, Activity 2.1)

**Rubric:** Summary Accuracy (coverage) — identifying main ideas.

**Input (~1 min):**  
- **Article A:** *Supporting schools to use face recognition systems: a continuance intention perspective of elementary school parents in China* (Hong et al., 2022)  
- **Article B:** *Facial recognition technology in schools: critical questions and concerns* (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020)

**What to do:** For each title, identify **Subject matter**, **Context**, **Purpose/stance** (Support / Promote / Reject / Doubt / Discuss).

**Demo (30–45 s):** Article A → Subject: FRT in schools; Context: parents, China, continuance intention; Stance: Support. Article B → Subject: FRT in schools; Context: schools; Stance: Doubt (“critical questions,” “concerns”).

**MC (1 min):**  
*What is the stance of Article B’s title?*  
A) Support  B) Promote  C) Doubt / Critical  D) Reject

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “What are subject, context, and stance for Article A? For Article B?”

**Writing (Moodle):** Post **one sentence** stating Article B’s subject + context + stance. Reply to one peer: Does it match the title? Yes/No + reason.

**Feedback (2 min):** C. Stance from “critical questions,” “concerns.”

---

### Task 2: Abstract structure — empirical vs conceptual (**Module 1**, Activity 2.2)

**Rubric:** Summary Accuracy — grasping main ideas from abstracts.

**Input (~1 min):**  
- **Empirical (Article A):** Background → Purpose → Methods → Results/Key findings → Implications.  
- **Conceptual (Article B):** Background → Theoretical problem/gap → Author’s argument → Analytical approach → Conclusion.

From Sample AWQ: Article A has methods (questionnaires, 380 parents, CFA, SEM) and findings (DBVW ↔ perceived value; innovativeness ↔ value; value ↔ continuance). Article B has no methods/results; it states concerns (surveillance, consent, authoritarian/oppressive) and questions whether FRT in schools can be justified.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show which parts of each abstract correspond to purpose, findings/arguments, implications.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which best describes Article A’s abstract?*  
A) It only discusses theories.  B) It reports questionnaire data and findings.  C) It rejects FRT in schools.  D) It has no methods.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “How does Article B’s abstract differ from Article A’s? (empirical vs conceptual)”

**Writing (Moodle):** In 2–3 sentences, contrast Article A’s and Article B’s abstract structure (empirical vs conceptual). Reply to one peer: Accurate? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Article A = empirical (methods, results); Article B = conceptual (argument, concerns).

---

### Task 3: Purpose statement (**Module 1**, Activity 2.4)

**Rubric:** Academic Tone & Clarity — understanding the paper’s central claim.

**Input (~1 min):**  
Purpose statement = central argument or main point, usually toward the **end of the Introduction**. It is a **debatable claim** the rest of the paper supports.

From Sample AWQ:  
- Article A: e.g. exploring parents’ DBVW and technological innovativeness in value perception and continuance intention re FRT.  
- Article B: e.g. school-based FRT raises social challenges and concerns; article considers whether a valid case can be made for FRT in schools.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Locate purpose-like sentences in the excerpts; link to stance (support vs doubt).

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is a purpose statement rather than a topic sentence?*  
A) “The average score of parents’ perceived value is 3.919.”  
B) “This study examined how technological innovativeness and DBVW influence parents’ perceived value and continuance intention.”  
C) “Another application of FRT in schools is attendance monitoring.”  
D) “Facial data lends itself to constant surveillance.”

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “What is the main claim of Article B? Where would you expect to find it?”

**Writing (Moodle):** Post **one sentence** that could serve as Article B’s purpose statement (claim + focus). Reply to one peer: Is it debatable? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Purpose = overall claim/goal; A/C/D are data, topic sentence, or evidence.

---

### Task 4: Section headings and argument structure (**Module 1**, Activity 2.3)

**Rubric:** Summary Accuracy — following the argument.

**Input (~1 min):**  
From Article B (Sample AWQ): “Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools”; “The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition.”  
Connect headings to **context** and **stance** (e.g. “additional issues,” “concerns,” “inescapability”).

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show how these headings structure the critique (challenge → inescapability → consent/opt-out).

**MC (1 min):**  
*What do Article B’s section headings primarily do?*  
A) Report empirical results.  B) Structure the critical argument and concerns.  C) Compare parents’ views.  D) Define FRT.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “How does ‘The inescapable nature…’ connect to the overall stance?”

**Writing (Moodle):** List **two** section headings from Article B and briefly say how each supports the article’s stance. Reply to one peer: Clear? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Headings organise the argument and concerns.

---

### Task 5: Topic sentences and support (**Module 1**, Activity 2.4)

**Rubric:** Academic Tone & Clarity — topic sentences; Summary Accuracy.

**Input (~1 min):**  
Topic sentence = main idea of a **body paragraph**, usually first (sometimes second). It supports the purpose statement.

Example from Article B: “Another point of concern is the inescapability of facial monitoring within school contexts.” The paragraph then explains constant surveillance, no self-curation, opt-out limitations, etc.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Identify that sentence; show how the rest of the paragraph elaborates (evidence, examples).

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which best describes a topic sentence?*  
A) It appears only in the abstract.  B) It states the main point of a paragraph and is supported by the rest.  C) It always includes statistics.  D) It summarises the whole article.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Identify one topic sentence in Article B’s excerpt. What does the paragraph add to it?”

**Writing (Moodle):** Post **one topic sentence** from Article B (quote or close paraphrase) and one sentence saying what the paragraph adds. Reply to one peer: Correct? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Topic sentence = paragraph’s main point, rest supports it.

---

## Week 3 — Hour 3 (5 tasks) — Module 2: Paraphrasing & summarising

**Focus:** Paraphrasing strategies, avoiding plagiarism, summarising steps, no personal bias, main-idea coverage. Use **Sample AWQ** excerpts and, where useful, **Student A / Student B** from `lessonsMoodle/Mat`.  
**Moodle:** `Moodle_posts/week3/W3H3_Task6` … `W3H3_Task10`.

**Source (Article B):** “There is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they ‘share’.”

**Demo (30–45 s):** “Too close” vs “Better”:  
- Too close: “There is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they share (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).”  
- Better: “Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argue that students cannot choose what facial data they share.”

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is the best paraphrase of “parents were willing to try technological innovation”?*  
A) Parents were willing to try technological innovation.

Paraphrasing = different words, **same meaning**, **cite source**. Avoid: copying phrases; changing only a few words; omitting citation.

**Example (from Module 2):** Original about commercial shift from detection to identification (Andrejevic & Selwyn).  
- Version 1: Paraphrased + cited → OK.  
- Version 2: Same idea, **no citation** → plagiarism.  
- Version 3: Paraphrased + cited → OK.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Compare the three versions; stress citation + substantive rewording.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which constitutes plagiarism?*  
A) Paraphrasing and citing (Author, year).  
B) Using the same idea in your own words with no citation.  
C) Short quote with “…” and (Author, year, p. X).  
D) Summarising and citing both sources.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Why is Version 2 (no citation) plagiarism even if words differ?”

**Input (~1 min):**  
Steps: (1) Read thoroughly; (2) **Identify key points** (main ideas, arguments); (3) **Eliminate** extraneous detail; (4) **Use your own words**; (5) Keep **author's tone**. Key points: benefits of FRT (growth, uses, e.g. social media); worries (lack of regulation); need for federal regulation; regulations balance benefits and protections. **Condense:** keep main claims, drop elaboration.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show "key point" vs "extraneous" using the McClellan paragraph.

**MC (1 min):**  
*When summarising McClellan's (2020) paragraph, which should you emphasise?*

**Rubric:** Summary Accuracy — free from personal bias; no “I think.”

**Input (~1 min):**  
Rule: Report only what the **sources** say. No “I think,” “perhaps,” “maybe,” “in my view,” “we face,” or unsupported speculation.

**Example – Unacceptable (Student B style):** “Maybe students don’t care, or it is not a big problem. … **So, I think that** Article A says parents like facial recognition…”

**Example – Acceptable:** “Hong et al. (2022) found that parents tended to support FRT despite privacy concerns. Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argue that FRT creates inescapable surveillance and undermines consent.”

**Demo (30–45 s):** Circle “Maybe…,” “I think…” in unacceptable example. Stress: **author + reporting verb + source’s claim**.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is acceptable in an AWQ summary?*  
A) I think both articles show that FRT is controversial.  
B) Perhaps schools will adopt FRT anyway.

### Task 10: Main-idea coverage — Article A and Article B (**Module 1 & 2**; Summary Accuracy)

**Rubric:** Summary Accuracy — includes all main ideas; no omission.

**Moodle post:** Includes **full Article A and Article B abstracts** (and titles). Framework: subject, context, stance, key finding/main argument; main idea = subject + stance + key finding/argument (one sentence).

**Input (~1 min):**  
**Article A:** Subject (FRT in schools); context (parents, China); stance (support); key findings (DBVW ↔ value; innovativeness ↔ value; value ↔ continuance; parents support FRT).  
**Article B:** Subject (FRT in schools); stance (critical); main concerns (surveillance, inescapability, consent/opt-out, authoritarian/oppressive).

**Task focus:** From the abstracts, write **one sentence** stating the main idea of **Article B** (subject + stance + key finding/argument).

**Demo (30–45 s):** Model one-sentence main idea for each article.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which best states the main idea of Article A?*  
A) Parents in China refuse to use face recognition.

Each body paragraph needs a **topic sentence** that states the paragraph’s main point and can **integrate both** sources (e.g. “The debate over FRT in schools centres on X versus Y (Author A, year; Author B, year).”).

Avoid: “Article A says… Article B says…” as topic sentences without a unifying claim.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Compare a weak topic sentence (“They talked about security”) with a stronger one that names both sources and the relationship.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is an effective topic sentence for a synthesis paragraph?*  
A) Article A is about parents. Article B is about surveillance.

**Rubric:** Summary Accuracy; Academic Tone & Clarity — relevant conclusion.

**Input (~1 min):**  
Conclusion should: **recap** main points (e.g. support vs concerns); **attribute** to sources; **no new claims** or “I think.”  
Avoid: structure-only (“The article has an intro and body”); personal take (“We must decide”); vague (“FRT is complex”).

**Example (Student A):** “While facial recognition is perceived as worthwhile by certain stakeholders, concerns about surveillance without students’ consent highlight its controversial nature in educational settings.”

**Demo (30–45 s):** Point out recap of both sides, no “I,” no new argument.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is an acceptable conclusion for the AWQ summary?*  
A) I think FRT is harmful and should be banned.  
B) The article has three main sections.  
C) In summary, Hong et al. (2022) show parents’ support for FRT, while Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) raise concerns about surveillance and consent.

Use precise **reporting verbs**: argue, suggest, note, outline, contend, caution, point out, found, indicate. Avoid: “mention,” “talk about,” “shows” (check subject–verb agreement), “assumes” (unless accurate).

**Demo (30–45 s):** Replace weak verbs in sample sentences with stronger ones; match verb to source’s strength (e.g. “argue” for clear stance, “suggest” for cautious claims).

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which reporting verb is most appropriate for Andrejevic and Selwyn’s critical stance?*  
A) Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) **mention** that FRT raises concerns.  
B) Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) **argue** that FRT raises concerns.  
C) Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) **assume** that FRT raises concerns.  
D) The authors **talk about** concerns.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Suggest a reporting verb for Hong et al.’s findings.”

**Writing (Moodle):** Write **one sentence** about each article using a **different** reporting verb and correct citation. Post both. Reply to one peer: Verbs appropriate? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. “Argue” fits a clear stance; “mention” is vague; “assume” misrepresents.

### Task 19: Direct quotation — when and how (**Module 1**, Part 4)

**Rubric:** Paraphrasing vs quotation; In-text Citations.

**Input (~1 min):**  
- **Short quote (≤40 words):** “…” (Author, year, p. X).  
- **Long quote (>40 words):** indent, no quotation marks, (Author, year, p. X) after.  
- Prefer **paraphrasing**; quote only when wording is itself important.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show short vs long format; when to quote vs paraphrase.

**MC (1 min):**  
*When is direct quotation preferred?*  
A) Whenever you use a source.  
B) When the exact wording is important (e.g. key term, striking phrase).  
C) Never; always paraphrase.  
D) Only in the reference list.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Identify one phrase in Article B you might quote; one you’d paraphrase.”

**Writing (Moodle):** Choose **one** short quote from Article A or B. Format it correctly with citation and page if available. Post it. Reply to one peer: Format correct? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. Quote when wording matters; otherwise paraphrase.

### Task 20: End-of-text reference list — journal article (**Module 1**, Part 4)

**Rubric:** In-text Citations / References (AWQ does not require a reference list; this supports other assignments).

**Input (~1 min):**  
Journal article: Author(s). (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical*, *volume*(issue), pages. https://doi.org/…  
Alphabetise by first author; hanging indent. **Secondary citations:** list only the source you read (e.g. Hong et al.), not the primary (e.g. Wang & Teo) if you cited “as cited in.”

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show correct format for Hong et al. (2022) and Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020).

**MC (1 min):**  
*In the reference list, you read Smith (2020) and cited Jones (2015) as cited in Smith (2020). Whom do you list?*  
A) Jones only.  B) Smith only.  C) Both.  D) Neither.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Why do we use hanging indent and alphabetical order?”

**Writing (Moodle):** Format **one** reference list entry for Article A or B (journal article). Post it. Reply to one peer: APA format correct? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** B. List only the source you actually read (Smith).
