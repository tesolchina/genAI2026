**Rubric:** In-text Citations — correct APA; appropriate use.

**Input (~1 min):**  
- **Author-prominent:** “Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argue that…” — emphasises authority, debate.  
- **Signal phrase:** “According to Hong et al. (2022), …” or “…as Hong et al. (2022) suggest.”  
- **Information-prominent:** “…parents support FRT (Hong et al., 2022).” Use **&** in parentheses; “and” in running text.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Show one example of each from Sample AWQ instructions or Student A.

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is **information-prominent**?*  
A) Hong et al. (2022) found that parents support FRT.  
B) According to Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020), FRT raises concerns.  
C) Parents tend to support FRT despite privacy concerns (Hong et al., 2022).  
D) Both A and B.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Convert C into an author-prominent citation.”

**Writing (Moodle):** Write **one sentence** about Article A or B using **signal phrase** citation. Post it. Reply to one peer: Type of citation? Correct APA? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** C. Information first; author and year in parentheses.

---

### Task 2: APA format — author, year, ampersand (**Module 1**; AWQ instructions)

**Rubric:** In-text Citations — correct APA.

**Input (~1 min):**  
Two authors: “Author A and Author B (year)” in text; “(Author A & Author B, year)” in parentheses. Space after comma; always include **year**.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Fix examples: “Selwyn(2020)” → “Selwyn (2020)”; “(Hong et al, 2022)” → “(Hong et al., 2022)”; “(Andrejevic & Selwyn)” → “(Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).”

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which is correctly formatted?*  
A) (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020)  
B) (Andrejevic and Selwyn 2020)  
C) Andrejevic & Selwyn (2020) in running text  
D) (Andrejevic, Selwyn, 2020)

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “When do we use ‘and’ vs ‘&’?”

**Writing (Moodle):** Post **two** in-text citations (one author-prominent, one information-prominent) for Article A and Article B. Reply to one peer: APA correct? Yes/No.

**Feedback (2 min):** A. “&” in parentheses; comma before year; both authors.

**Demo (30–45 s):** Replace weak verbs in sample sentences; match verb to source’s strength (e.g. “argue” for clear stance, “suggest” for cautious claims).

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which reporting verb is most appropriate for Andrejevic and Selwyn’s critical stance?*  
A) Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) **mention** that FRT raises concerns.

**Template:** “While there is some truth in [opposing view], this overlooks [flaw]. In reality, [your response] because [evidence/logic].”  
**Example (Module 3):** “While FRT may streamline attendance, this overlooks its discriminatory impact. In reality, schools must reject such biased tools because FRT misidentifies non-white students at higher rates (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).”

**Demo (30–45 s):** Use Module 3 FRT fallibility extract. Show how to plug it into the “Yes, but” template.

**MC (1 min):**  
*What does “While there is some truth in X” achieve?*

**MC (1 min):**  
*Which best uses **evidence** to challenge an opposing claim?*

C) FRT is bad.  
D) Some people think FRT helps.

**Speaking (1 min):** In pairs: “Say one evidence-based counterargument about FRT or chatbots using a cited source.”

**Writing (Moodle):** Write **one** evidence-based counterargument (2–3 sentences) about FRT in schools or chatbots, using **one** cited source (e.g. Andrejevic & Selwyn, Hong et al., or Module 3 examples). Post it. Reply to one peer: Authority cited? Opposing claim undermined? Yes/No.
