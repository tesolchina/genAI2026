<h2>1. Reading materials</h2>

<h3>What is a purpose statement?</h3>

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>The <strong>purpose statement</strong> is the central argument or main point of the entire paper. It is usually found toward the <strong>end of the Introduction</strong>. It should be a <strong>debatable claim</strong> (not a mere fact or question) that the rest of the paper supports.</p>
</div>

<h3>Article A — Purpose and framework (from Abstract &amp; Discussion)</h3>

<div style="background-color: #e7f3ff; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>From the abstract:</strong> “To address this gap in the literature, <strong>this study examined how</strong> different degrees of technological innovativeness and dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW) <strong>influence parents' perceived value</strong> of using and <strong>intention to continue supporting</strong> schools' use of face recognition systems.”</p>
    <p><strong>From the discussion:</strong> “In line with this, the present study <strong>explored</strong> parents' DBVW and technological innovativeness in the value perception of the use of face-recognition systems, and continuous intention to use such systems as a research framework.”</p>
</div>

<h3>Article B — Abstract (claim and focus)</h3>

<div style="background-color: #e7f3ff; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>“While critical commentators are beginning to question the pedagogical limitations of facially driven learning, <strong>this article contends that</strong> school-based facial recognition <strong>presents a number of other social challenges and concerns</strong> that merit specific attention. This includes the likelihood of facial recognition technology altering the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines. Against this background, <strong>the article considers whether or not a valid case can ever be made</strong> for allowing this form of technology in schools.”</p>
</div>

<h3>Not purpose statements (for comparison)</h3>

<div style="background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #f44336; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>These are <strong>data</strong>, <strong>topic sentences</strong>, or <strong>evidence</strong>, not the overall purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“The average score of parents' perceived value is 3.919.” → <em>data</em></li>
        <li>“Another application of FRT in schools is attendance monitoring.” → <em>topic sentence</em></li>
        <li>“Facial data lends itself to constant surveillance.” → <em>evidence</em></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>2. What to do</h2>

<p>Write <strong>one sentence</strong> that could serve as <strong>Article B’s</strong> purpose statement: a debatable claim + the article’s focus (e.g. social challenges and concerns about FRT in schools; whether a valid case can be made for FRT).</p>

<h2>3. How to reply (Moodle forum)</h2>

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Your post</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Reply</strong> in this forum discussion.</li>
        <li>Write <strong>one sentence</strong> that could act as Article B’s purpose statement (claim + focus).</li>
        <li>Make sure it is a <strong>debatable claim</strong>, not just a fact or a question.</li>
        <li>Post your reply.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>“Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argue that school-based facial recognition raises serious social challenges and concerns, and the article considers whether a valid case can ever be made for allowing FRT in schools.”</em></p>

    <p><strong>Reply to one peer</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Read a classmate’s post.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Reply</strong> to their post.</li>
        <li>Write: <strong>Is it debatable?</strong> Answer <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>, and give <strong>one brief reason</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>“Yes. It states a clear claim about FRT’s challenges and poses a debatable question about whether FRT in schools can be justified.”</em></p>

<h2>4. Teacher: verbal prompts</h2>

<div style="background-color: #fce4ec; border: 1px solid #e91e63; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Multiple-choice (optional, ~1 min)</strong></p>
    <p><em>Which is a purpose statement rather than a topic sentence?</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A) “The average score of parents' perceived value is 3.919.”</li>
        <li>B) “This study examined how technological innovativeness and DBVW influence parents' perceived value and continuance intention.”</li>
        <li>C) “Another application of FRT in schools is attendance monitoring.”</li>
        <li>D) “Facial data lends itself to constant surveillance.”</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f3e5f5; border: 1px solid #9c27b0; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Pair discussion (~1 min)</strong></p>
    <p>Ask students to work in pairs and say aloud:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“What is the <strong>main claim</strong> of Article B?”</li>
        <li>“Where would you <strong>expect to find</strong> the purpose statement in an article (e.g. Introduction, end of Intro)?”</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p><em>Tip:</em> Use these prompts before or after students post on the forum, as fits your class flow.</p>
