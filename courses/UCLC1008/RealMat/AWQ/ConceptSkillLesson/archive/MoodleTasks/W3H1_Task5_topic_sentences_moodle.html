<h3>What is a topic sentence?</h3>

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>The <strong>topic sentence</strong> states the <strong>main idea</strong> of a single <strong>body paragraph</strong>. It is usually the <strong>first sentence</strong> (sometimes the second). It introduces the point that the rest of the paragraph discusses and supports. It should connect back to the article’s <strong>purpose statement</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Article B — One body paragraph (under “The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition”)</h3>

<div style="background-color: #e7f3ff; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; padding: 10px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Article B</strong> — Andrejevic &amp; Selwyn (2020). <em>Facial recognition technology in schools: critical questions and concerns.</em></p>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Another point of concern is the inescapability of facial monitoring within school contexts.</strong> Unlike other forms of personal data (i.e., any piece of data connected to an individual's name), facial data lends itself to constant and permanent surveillance. In short, people are always connected to their faces. Thus, unlike social media posts or interactions with school learning management systems, there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they 'share'. While students might be able to opt-out from facial detection elements of their school's learning systems (for example, the use of eye-tracking or facial thermal imaging for learning analytics), there is no right to decline to participate in 'non-cooperative' facial recognition systems (indeed, any opt-out effectively renders campus facial recognition systems ineffective). While such coercion applies to the use of facial recognition in all public spaces, it is especially acute in schools. For example, most schools enforce dress codes that preclude students' faces being covered by hair, hoods or other obtrusions. This makes it difficult for students to obscure their faces from surveillance cameras. This also raises the inadequacy of any promise of 'informed consent' regarding school facial recognition systems. The systems being deployed in schools for security and attendance purposes rely on complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors in order to operate. This renders 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' approaches counter-productive from the point of view of the system provider. Even if opt-out protocols are in place, the system has to scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out.</p>

    <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Topic sentence:</strong> “Another point of concern is the inescapability of facial monitoring within school contexts.”</li>
        <li><strong>What the paragraph adds:</strong> Evidence and examples — e.g. constant surveillance, no self-curation, opt-out limitations, dress codes, inadequacy of informed consent, opt-in/opt-out impracticality.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>2. What to do</h2>

<p>Post <strong>one topic sentence</strong> from Article B’s excerpt (you may quote or use a close paraphrase) and <strong>one sentence</strong> saying what the paragraph <strong>adds</strong> (e.g. evidence, examples, explanations).</p>

<h2>3. How to reply (Moodle forum)</h2>

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Your post</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Reply</strong> in this forum discussion.</li>
        <li>Write <strong>two sentences</strong>:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sentence 1:</strong> The topic sentence from Article B (quote or close paraphrase). Use the “inescapability” paragraph above.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentence 2:</strong> What the paragraph adds — e.g. evidence, examples, or explanations that support that main point.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Post your reply.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Topic sentence: “Another point of concern is the inescapability of facial monitoring within school contexts.”</em></li>
        <li><em>The paragraph adds evidence and examples: constant surveillance, no option to self-curate data, opt-out limitations, dress codes making it hard to obscure faces, and the inadequacy of informed consent.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Read a classmate’s post.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Reply</strong> to their post.</li>
        <li>Write: <strong>Is their topic sentence and “what the paragraph adds” correct?</strong> Answer <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>, and give <strong>one brief reason</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>“Yes. They identified the topic sentence correctly and accurately described how the rest of the paragraph supports it with evidence and examples.”</em></p>

<h2>4. Teacher: verbal prompts</h2>

    <p><strong>Multiple-choice (optional, ~1 min)</strong></p>
    <p><em>Which best describes a topic sentence?</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A) It appears only in the abstract.</li>
        <li>B) It states the main point of a paragraph and is supported by the rest.</li>
        <li>C) It always includes statistics.</li>
        <li>D) It summarises the whole article.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f3e5f5; border: 1px solid #9c27b0; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">

    <p>Ask students to work in pairs and say aloud:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“Identify <strong>one topic sentence</strong> in Article B’s excerpt.”</li>
        <li>“What does the <strong>paragraph add</strong> to that topic sentence?”</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p><em>Tip:</em> Use these prompts before or after students post on the forum, as fits your class flow.</p>
