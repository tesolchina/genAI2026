# Week 3 Hour 3 — 5 Moodle forum tasks

HTML files for **Moodle forum** discussions. Each task includes reading materials, clear reply instructions, and teacher verbal prompts. **Correct answers are not included** in the teacher prompts (these materials are shared with students).

## Files

| File | Task | Module 2 focus |
|------|------|----------------|

## Reading materials

Tasks 6, 7, 9, and 10 use **UCLC1008 (2526a) Sample AWQ** — Articles A (Hong et al., 2022) and B (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). Task 7 also uses the Module 2 plagiarism example (three versions). **Task 8** uses a **different source**: **McClellan (2020)** from Module 2 (Examples of summarising), not the Sample AWQ. Reading excerpts are **included in each HTML**.

## How to use in Moodle

1. Create **5 separate forum topics** for Week 3 Hour 3.
2. Paste each HTML file’s content into the **post body** of the corresponding forum topic (use the HTML editor / “<>” source view).
3. Students **Reply** with their answer, then **Reply to one peer** per task as instructed.

## Teacher prompts

- **MC** and **pair discussion** prompts are included in each file.
- **Correct answers are omitted** so the tasks can be shared with students.
