<h2>1. Reading materials</h2>

<p>Use the excerpt from <strong>Article B</strong> below. Notice the <strong>section headings</strong> and how they connect to the article’s <strong>context</strong> and <strong>stance</strong> (e.g. “additional issues,” “concerns,” “inescapability”).</p>

<div style="background-color: #e7f3ff; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; padding: 10px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Article B</strong> — Andrejevic &amp; Selwyn (2020). <em>Facial recognition technology in schools: critical questions and concerns.</em></p>
</div>

<h3>Discussion – Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools</h3>

<div style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>These questions over diminished notions of pedagogy and consent are important. Yet, at this point, we would like to argue that there are a number of <strong>additional issues and concerns</strong> that cast further serious doubt upon the implementation of facial recognition technologies in schools. In brief, the following points of contention might be raised:</p>

    <p><strong>The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition</strong></p>

    <p>Another point of concern is the inescapability of facial monitoring within school contexts. Unlike other forms of personal data (i.e., any piece of data connected to an individual's name), facial data lends itself to constant and permanent surveillance. In short, people are always connected to their faces. Thus, unlike social media posts or interactions with school learning management systems, there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they 'share'. While students might be able to opt-out from facial detection elements of their school's learning systems (for example, the use of eye-tracking or facial thermal imaging for learning analytics), there is no right to decline to participate in 'non-cooperative' facial recognition systems (indeed, any opt-out effectively renders campus facial recognition systems ineffective). While such coercion applies to the use of facial recognition in all public spaces, it is especially acute in schools. For example, most schools enforce dress codes that preclude students' faces being covered by hair, hoods or other obtrusions. This makes it difficult for students to obscure their faces from surveillance cameras. This also raises the inadequacy of any promise of 'informed consent' regarding school facial recognition systems. The systems being deployed in schools for security and attendance purposes rely on complete sweeps of classrooms and corridors in order to operate. This renders 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' approaches counter-productive from the point of view of the system provider. Even if opt-out protocols are in place, the system has to scan a student's face before it can recognise that they have opted out.</p>

    <p><strong>Section headings in Article B</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>“Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools”</strong> — frames the critique; “additional issues and concerns,” “doubt”</li>
        <li><strong>“The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition”</strong> — one main concern: inescapability, surveillance, consent/opt-out</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>2. What to do</h2>

<p>List <strong>two</strong> section headings from Article B and briefly explain <strong>how each supports the article’s stance</strong> (critical/doubt about FRT in schools).</p>

<h2>3. How to reply (Moodle forum)</h2>

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Your post</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Reply</strong> in this forum discussion.</li>
        <li>Write <strong>two</strong> bullet points (or two short sentences), one per heading:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Name the <strong>heading</strong>.</li>
            <li>In one sentence, say <strong>how it supports</strong> the article’s stance (e.g. structures the critical argument, introduces a key concern).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Post your reply.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>“Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools” — Introduces the critique and “additional issues and concerns” that cast doubt on FRT in schools.</em></li>
        <li><em>“The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition” — Develops one main concern (inescapability, surveillance, consent) that supports the critical stance.</em></li>
    </ul>

<h2>4. Teacher: verbal prompts</h2>

<div style="background-color: #fce4ec; border: 1px solid #e91e63; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Multiple-choice (optional, ~1 min)</strong></p>
    <p><em>What do Article B’s section headings primarily do?</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A) Report empirical results.</li>
        <li>B) Structure the critical argument and concerns.</li>
        <li>C) Compare parents’ views.</li>
        <li>D) Define FRT.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f3e5f5; border: 1px solid #9c27b0; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Pair discussion (~1 min)</strong></p>
    <p>Ask students to work in pairs and say aloud:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“How does <strong>‘The inescapable nature of school-based facial recognition’</strong> connect to the article’s <strong>overall stance</strong>?”</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p><em>Tip:</em> Use these prompts before or after students post on the forum, as fits your class flow.</p>
