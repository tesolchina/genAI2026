<h1>Week 3 Hour 3 — Task 9: No personal bias (report sources only)</h1>

<p><strong>Module 2</strong> · <strong>Rubric:</strong> Summary Accuracy (free from personal bias; no “I think”)</p>
<p><em>Reading materials: Rule, examples, and sentence to rewrite (below) — Sample AWQ Sample Scripts, lessonsMoodle/Mat.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Reading materials</h2>

<h3>Rule for AWQ summaries</h3>

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>Report only what the <strong>sources</strong> say. Do <strong>not</strong> add your own views, speculation, or phrases like “I think,” “perhaps,” “maybe,” “in my view,” “we face,” or “I believe.”</p>
</div>

<h3>Example — Unacceptable (Student B style)</h3>

<div style="background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #f44336; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>“Article B says facial recognition is bad because there is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they share. Students don't have freedom to choose to opt out. <strong>Maybe students don't care, or it is not a big problem.</strong> The technology might just help schools be more organized (Andrejevic &amp; Selwyn). <strong>So, I think that</strong> Article A says parents like facial recognition because of its value…”</p>
</div>

<h3>Example — Acceptable</h3>

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>“Hong et al. (2022) found that parents tended to support FRT despite privacy concerns. Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argue that FRT creates inescapable surveillance and undermines consent.”</p>
</div>

<p>Use <strong>author + year + reporting verb + source’s claim</strong> only. No personal view.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. What to do</h2>

<p>Rewrite the sentence below so it has <strong>no</strong> personal view. Use the source (Andrejevic &amp; Selwyn, 2020) and report only their claims. Post your rewrite.</p>

<p><strong>Sentence to rewrite:</strong> “I believe that Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) raise important concerns about consent.”</p>

<h2>3. How to reply (Moodle forum)</h2>

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">

    <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Reply</strong> in this forum discussion.</li>
        <li>Write your <strong>rewrite</strong> (no “I believe,” “I think,” or similar; attribute the claim to the authors).</li>
        <li>Post your reply.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>“Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) raise important concerns about consent regarding FRT in schools.”</em></p>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #fff8e1; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Reply to one peer</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Read a classmate’s post.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Reply</strong> to their post.</li>
        <li>Write: <strong>Is their version free of personal bias?</strong> Answer <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>, and give <strong>one brief reason</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>“Yes. They removed ‘I believe’ and reported only what the authors argue.”</em></p>
</div>

<h2>4. Teacher: verbal prompts</h2>

<div style="background-color: #fce4ec; border: 1px solid #e91e63; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Multiple-choice (optional, ~1 min)</strong></p>
    <p><em>Which is acceptable in an AWQ summary?</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A) I think both articles show that FRT is controversial.</li>
        <li>B) Perhaps schools will adopt FRT anyway.</li>
        <li>C) Hong et al. (2022) found that parents tended to support FRT despite privacy concerns.</li>
        <li>D) In my view, Article B is more convincing.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f3e5f5; border: 1px solid #9c27b0; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Pair discussion (~1 min)</strong></p>
    <p>Ask students to work in pairs and say aloud:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“Which option would you choose, and why?”</li>
        <li>“Say an unacceptable version of C that adds personal bias.”</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p><em>Tip:</em> Use these prompts before or after students post on the forum, as fits your class flow.</p>
