## Reading materials

All tasks use **UCLC1008 (2526a) Sample AWQ** — Articles A (Hong et al., 2022) and B (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020). Reading excerpts are **included in each HTML** so students do not need separate documents.

## How to use in Moodle

1. Create **5 separate forum topics** (or discussion threads) for Week 3 Hour 1.
2. Paste each HTML file’s content into the **post body** of the corresponding forum topic (use the HTML editor / “<>” source view).
3. Students **Reply** to each topic with their answer, then **Reply to one peer** per task as instructed.

## Structure of each HTML

- **1. Reading materials** — Embedded excerpts and any frameworks.
- **2. What to do** — Task focus.
- **3. How to reply (Moodle forum)** — Step-by-step instructions for the **main post** and for the **peer reply** (what to write, format, examples).
- **4. Teacher: verbal prompts** — Optional **MC** and **pair discussion** prompts to use in class before/after forum posting.
