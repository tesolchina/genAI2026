<h2>1. Reading materials</h2>

<h3>What counts as plagiarism when paraphrasing?</h3>

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>Paraphrasing = <strong>different words</strong>, <strong>same meaning</strong>, and you must <strong>cite the source</strong>. Avoid: copying phrases; changing only a few words; omitting the citation.</p>
</div>

<h3>Original text (Andrejevic &amp; Selwyn, 2020)</h3>

<div style="background-color: #e7f3ff; border-left: 4px solid #2196F3; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>“Tellingly, these applications are beginning to shift from detection technology to identification technology as commercial outlets strive to link camera data with purchasing information. When facial recognition systems become widespread, detection applications (such as ‘mood’ inference) will also be implemented for purposes including marketing and security.”</p>
</div>

<h3>Three versions</h3>

<div style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Version 1:</strong> Commercial outlets are shifting from using detection technology to identification technology for applications such as marketing and security (Andrejevic &amp; Selwyn, 2020).</p>
    <p><strong>Version 2:</strong> Private enterprises are now focusing on using identification technology to facilitate better collection of purchasing data, such as customers’ mood, for adjusting their marketing strategies.</p>
    <p><strong>Version 3:</strong> Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) point out that there is a shift towards the commercialisation of identification technology as facial recognition gains traction, with marketing and security being the focus of commercial interest.</p>
</div>

<p>Decide which version(s) are acceptable and which constitute plagiarism. Consider: paraphrasing vs copying, and presence or absence of citation.</p>

<h3>Excerpts you may choose from (Article A and B)</h3>

<p>For the writing task below, pick <strong>one</strong> of the following sentences to paraphrase. Each is from the Sample AWQ (Articles A or B).</p>

<div style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Article A — Hong et al. (2022)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>“The average score of parents' perceived value is 3.919, which is much higher than the neutral level (3.000).”</li>
        <li>“Although the parent respondents thought that the face recognition system had certain risks, they were willing to try technological innovation and they thought the system was valuable, so they intended to continue using it.”</li>
        <li>“The results suggest that parents support the use of face recognition systems in elementary schools; thus, such systems can be adopted by other elementary schools in other areas.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Article B — Andrejevic &amp; Selwyn (2020)</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>“There is no option for students to self-curate and restrict what data they 'share'.”</li>
        <li>“Unlike other forms of personal data, facial data lends itself to constant and permanent surveillance.”</li>
        <li>“This article contends that school-based facial recognition presents a number of other social challenges and concerns that merit specific attention.”</li>
    </ul>
</div>
