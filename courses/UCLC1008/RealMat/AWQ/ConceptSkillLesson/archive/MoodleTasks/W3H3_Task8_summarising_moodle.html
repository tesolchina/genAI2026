<h3>Steps to summarising</h3>

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Read thoroughly</strong> — understand content and structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify key points</strong> — main ideas, arguments; distinguish from supporting details.</li>
        <li><strong>Eliminate extraneous information</strong> — omit raw stats, long examples, detailed methodology unless briefly summarised.</li>
        <li><strong>Use your own words</strong> — no copying.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the author’s tone</strong> — e.g. neutral, critical.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Source text — McClellan (2020)</h3>

    <p><strong>McClellan (2020)</strong> — on facial recognition technology, regulation, and public concerns. <em>Module 2, Examples of summarising.</em></p>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p>The use of facial recognition technology (FRT) has continued to grow and expand, providing helpful and creative uses in almost all aspects of life. The expansive use of the technology in social media, in particular, has begun to facilitate conversation amongst not only lawmakers, but everyday citizens as well. Although fairly new and exciting to some, facial recognition technology has become increasingly worrisome for many, in part due to the lack of regulations surrounding the technology. As facial recognition technology evolves and expands, there is an increasing need for regulation at the federal level. These regulations should consider and incorporate language that will allow the technology to continue providing benefits to society, but also ensure that limitations and penalties are placed on users of the technology to protect citizens.</p>
    <p><em>(McClellan, 2020, p. 364)</em></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Key points</strong> to include: benefits of FRT (growth, uses, e.g. in social media); worries (lack of regulation); need for federal regulation; regulations should balance benefits and protections (limitations, penalties). <strong>Omit</strong> or shorten: lengthy examples, repeated phrases.</p>

<p>Condense to <strong>1–2 sentences</strong>: keep the main claims (benefits, worries, call for regulation), drop the elaboration.</p>

<h2>3. How to reply (Moodle forum)</h2>

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Your post</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Reply</strong> in this forum discussion.</li>
        <li>Write your <strong>summary</strong> (1–2 sentences, own words, no copying; main claims only, no elaboration).</li>
        <li>Add an in-text citation (McClellan, 2020) when you refer to the author’s claims.</li>
        <li>Post your reply.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>McClellan (2020) argues that although FRT has grown and offers benefits in many areas, including social media and public debate, lack of regulation has increased public concern. The author calls for federal regulation that both preserves the technology’s benefits and introduces limits and penalties to protect citizens.</em></p>
