<h3>Article A — Abstract (Hong et al., 2022)</h3>

    <p><strong><em>Supporting schools to use face recognition systems: a continuance intention perspective of elementary school parents in China</em></strong></p>
    <p>A great deal of attention has been focused on technological innovation, for example, face recognition, which has been used in some countries in various fields. Nonetheless, there has been little attention paid to parents' acceptance of the use of face recognition systems on campus. To address this gap in the literature, this study examined how different degrees of technological innovativeness and dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW) influence parents' perceived value of using and intention to continue supporting schools' use of face recognition systems. This study adopted snowball sampling to collect data through questionnaires, and received 380 valid responses from parents living in Xuzhou, China. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to analyse the data, with results indicating that: (1) DBVW was negatively related to perceived value; (2) technological innovativeness was positively related to perceived value; and (3) perceived value was positively related to continuance intention to use face recognition systems. The results suggest that parents support the use of face recognition systems in elementary schools; thus, such systems can be adopted by other elementary schools in other areas.</p>

<h3>Article B — Abstract (Andrejevic &amp; Selwyn, 2020)</h3>

    <p><strong><em>Facial recognition technology in schools: critical questions and concerns</em></strong></p>
    <p>Facial recognition technology is now being introduced across various aspects of public life. This includes the burgeoning integration of facial recognition and facial detection into compulsory schooling to address issues such as campus security, automated registration and student emotion detection. So far, these technologies have largely been seen as routine additions to school systems with already extensive cultures of monitoring and surveillance. While critical commentators are beginning to question the pedagogical limitations of facially driven learning, this article contends that school-based facial recognition presents a number of other social challenges and concerns that merit specific attention. This includes the likelihood of facial recognition technology altering the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines. Against this background, the article considers whether or not a valid case can ever be made for allowing this form of technology in schools.</p>

<h2>2. What to do</h2>

<p>In <strong>2–3 sentences</strong>, <strong>contrast</strong> Article A’s and Article B’s abstract structure: explain how one is <strong>empirical</strong> (methods, results) and the other <strong>conceptual</strong> (argument, concerns, no methods/results).</p>

<h2>3. How to reply (Moodle forum)</h2>

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Your post</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click <strong>Reply</strong> in this forum discussion.</li>
        <li>Write <strong>2–3 sentences</strong> contrasting Article A’s and Article B’s abstract structure.</li>
        <li>State clearly: (a) which article is empirical and why (e.g. methods, findings), and (b) which is conceptual and why (e.g. argument, concerns, no methods/results).</li>
        <li>Post your reply.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>“Article A’s abstract is empirical: it describes methods (e.g. questionnaires, 380 parents, CFA/SEM) and reports results (DBVW, innovativeness, perceived value, continuance intention). Article B’s abstract is conceptual: it presents the authors’ argument and concerns about FRT in schools (e.g. surveillance, authoritarian/oppressive potential) and questions whether a valid case can be made for FRT, but it does not report methods or data.”</em></p>

    <p><em>Which best describes Article A’s abstract?</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A) It only discusses theories.</li>
        <li>B) It reports questionnaire data and findings.</li>
        <li>C) It rejects FRT in schools.</li>
        <li>D) It has no methods.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f3e5f5; border: 1px solid #9c27b0; padding: 12px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p><strong>Pair discussion (~1 min)</strong></p>
    <p>Ask students to work in pairs and say aloud:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“How does Article B’s abstract <strong>differ</strong> from Article A’s? (Think: empirical vs conceptual.)”</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p><em>Tip:</em> Use these prompts before or after students post on the forum, as fits your class flow.</p>
