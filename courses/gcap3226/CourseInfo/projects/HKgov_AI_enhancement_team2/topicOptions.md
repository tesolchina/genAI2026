# Topic Options for HK Government AI Efficiency Pilots

**Date:** February 11, 2026
**Project Focus:** AI Efficacy Enhancement Team pilots and department-level efficiency gains
**Goal:** Select one department for a focused case study

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines three possible case-study directions aligned with the AI Efficacy Enhancement Team announcement. Each topic focuses on a single department and evaluates whether AI adoption is linked to measurable improvements in service efficiency and data-informed decision-making. The final selection should be based on data availability, public impact, and access to stakeholders.

## Option 1: Companies Registry -- AI for Company Registration Workflows

### Research Question
How has AI adoption (or planned adoption) in the Companies Registry affected processing time, service quality, and workload management for company registration and annual returns?

### Data Sources (Initial Targets)
- Companies Registry annual reports and performance pledges
- GovHK press releases on AI pilots
- LegCo papers or questions related to Companies Registry processing time
- data.gov.hk datasets referencing company registration volumes

### Action Plan
1. Map the registration workflow and identify AI entry points (e.g., document triage, validation, classification).
2. Gather baseline metrics: volume of applications, processing time, backlog size (if available).
3. Locate any public benchmarks or service pledges and compare with actual outcomes.
4. Draft information requests under the Code on Access to Information for:
   - Processing time distribution before and after AI pilot
   - AI tools in use and their scope
   - Staffing changes or workflow reallocation

### Potential Challenges
- Processing time data may not be publicly granular
- AI rollout details might be limited to high-level statements

## Option 2: Transport Department -- AI in Licensing and Permit Services

### Research Question
Does AI adoption in the Transport Department improve licensing and permit processing efficiency and user experience without reducing service quality?

### Data Sources (Initial Targets)
- Transport Department annual reports and service pledge indicators
- GovHK press releases about AI pilot scope
- LegCo papers on licensing or permit backlogs
- data.gov.hk datasets on licensing volume or complaints

### Action Plan
1. Identify high-volume services (e.g., vehicle licensing, permits, renewals).
2. Collect available metrics on processing time, volume, and service pledge performance.
3. Compare pre- and post-pilot service indicators where possible.
4. Draft information requests for:
   - AI tools used and specific process steps
   - Changes in processing time or customer service performance
   - Staffing allocation or training for AI-enabled workflows

### Potential Challenges
- Metrics may be aggregated and not directly linked to AI usage
- Multiple services may make scope definition harder

## Option 3: Buildings Department -- AI in Plan Approvals and Permits

### Research Question
Can AI-assisted review in the Buildings Department reduce approval times and improve transparency for plan approvals or permit processing?

### Data Sources (Initial Targets)
- Buildings Department annual reports and performance pledges
- GovHK press releases on AI pilot use cases
- LegCo papers related to building approvals or safety enforcement
- data.gov.hk datasets related to building approvals and enforcement actions

### Action Plan
1. Define a specific workflow: plan approvals, permits, or inspections.
2. Collect baseline metrics: approval volume, average processing time, backlog.
3. Identify public complaints or industry feedback on approval delays.
4. Draft information requests for:
   - AI usage scope in plan review or inspection workflows
   - Pre/post processing time metrics
   - Quality assurance measures for AI-assisted review

### Potential Challenges
- Data may be restricted or published annually only
- Approval timelines can be influenced by many external factors

## Selection Criteria (Use to decide one department)

- Data availability and granularity
- Clear and measurable workflow outcomes
- Public impact and policy relevance
- Feasibility of information requests and interviews
- Alignment with course focus on data-informed decisions

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Use the search plan in explore.md to collect 3 to 5 concrete data points per department.
2. Rank each option against the selection criteria.
3. Choose one department and draft a short project scope statement (200-300 words).
