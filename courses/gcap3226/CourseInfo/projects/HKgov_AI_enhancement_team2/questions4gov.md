# Questions for Government (Code on Access to Information)

Date: February 11, 2026
Project: HK Government AI Efficiency Pilots

## Q1: AI pilot scope and workflow details (by department)
Please provide a list of the administrative procedures selected for AI pilots in:
- Companies Registry
- Transport Department
- Buildings Department
Include the process step(s) where AI is applied, the purpose of the tool, and the deployment timeline.

Why: The public announcement lists departments but does not specify the procedures or workflows.

## Q2: Baseline and post-pilot performance metrics
Please provide baseline (pre-AI) and post-pilot metrics for the selected procedures, including:
- Processing time (average and distribution)
- Backlog size
- Volume of applications/requests
- Error/appeal rates (if available)

Why: Evaluation requires measurable changes in efficiency and service quality.

## Q3: Governance, procurement, and risk controls
Please provide information on AI governance for the pilots, including:
- Procurement approach and vendor selection
- Data sources used for training or deployment
- Risk assessment, bias checks, and human oversight measures

Why: The project evaluates whether AI adoption is responsible and data-informed.
