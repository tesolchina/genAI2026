Project focus: HK government AI Efficacy Enhancement Team and department-level pilots
Team goal: select one government department for a focused case study

Context (from news.md)
- Government announced AI trials in three departments: Companies Registry, Transport Department, Buildings Department
- Target: 200 procedures with AI by 2027; 100 in 2026
- Stated goal: efficiency and service quality, not cost cutting or job reductions

What to explore (open until a department is selected)
1) Which department provides the clearest, measurable workflow for AI impact?
2) What data exists today about processing time, volume, and service outcomes?
3) How can we verify whether decisions were data-informed?
4) What evidence is publicly available vs. what requires information requests?

Primary sources to search
- GovHK press releases and policy address materials
- Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB)
- Departmental annual reports and performance pledges
- LegCo papers and minutes referencing AI adoption
- data.gov.hk datasets linked to the selected department
