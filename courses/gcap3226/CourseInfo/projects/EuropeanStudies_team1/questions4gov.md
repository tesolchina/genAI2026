# Questions for Government (Code on Access to Information)

Date: February 11, 2026
Project: Hong Kong - Europe Relations

## Q1: Visitor and resident travel breakdown by European country
Please provide annual inbound and outbound passenger/visitor traffic with country-level breakdowns for European countries (2016-2025), including:
- Visitor arrivals and departures by country
- Hong Kong resident outbound trips to each European country
- Mode of travel (air/sea/land) where applicable

Why: The DATA.GOV.HK immigration datasets provide overall traffic totals but do not always include country-level breakdowns needed to analyze HK-Europe flows.

## Q2: Student visa approvals by country/region (Europe)
Please provide the annual number of student visa / entry permit approvals by country for European applicants (2016-2025), with program level if available.

Why: The student visa dataset exists but does not clearly list European-country breakdowns in the public tables.

## Q3: Economic and Trade Office outcomes in Europe
Please provide annual performance indicators (2019-2025) for Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices in Europe, including:
- Trade and investment facilitation outcomes
- Events or initiatives delivered
- Budget and staffing levels

Why: The project evaluates HK-Europe relations and needs measurable indicators of official engagement and outcomes.
