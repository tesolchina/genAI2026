# Generic Outline: LegCo Complaint Report

> This is a template for all teams. Replace bracketed placeholders with your project-specific content. Replace all functional headings (e.g. "Background: The Problem") with thematic headings that tell your story.

---

## [Your Thematic Title]

- Should capture the core complaint in one line
- Be specific, not generic
- Example: "Bridging the Gap: Improving Access to Rare Disease Treatment in Hong Kong"
- Not: "Rare Disease Report"

---

## Executive Summary

- 1–2 paragraphs; write this last
- State the problem in one sentence
- State what the government is currently doing (briefly)
- State what is wrong or missing
- State what should change

---

## [Thematic heading for: Background — The Problem]

- What is the government programme under review?
- What are the goals of this programme?
- Who are the stakeholders affected?
- What publicly available evidence describes the current situation?
  - Media articles
  - Government documents and websites
  - LegCo questions and replies
  - Research reports and statistics
- Reference: your team's `WebSearchReport.md` and `public-info.md`

> **Tip:** Focus on specific decisions by government staff, not broad policies. A programme is concrete with measurable KPIs; a policy is abstract.

---

## [Thematic heading for: Existing Solution]

- What is the government currently doing to address this issue?
- Name the specific programme(s), unit(s), and budget(s) involved
- What are the stated objectives and KPIs?
- What evidence is there about the programme's performance?
- Use official government sources

---

## [Thematic heading for: Room for Improvement]

- Present your hypotheses: how could the government do a better job?
- Each hypothesis should be:
  - Stated clearly
  - Supported by evidence from public sources
  - Linked to specific government decisions or actions
- Identify what evidence is needed to confirm or reject each hypothesis
- If evidence is absent, note that this is a gap to be filled through government enquiries

> **Key question:** What are the working theories about how government staff can improve their work?

---

## [Thematic heading for: Government's Replies to Our Enquiries]

- Questions sent under the Code on Access to Information
  - Date sent
  - To which department/bureau
  - Expected response time (21–49 calendar days)
- Summary of replies received (or note if still pending)
- Analysis of the replies:
  - Did the government address the question directly?
  - Was the response adequate and timely?
  - What did the reply reveal or confirm?
  - What was left unanswered?

> **Note:** If replies have not yet been received, include the questions sent and your anticipated answers. Plan how you would handle limited or evasive responses.

---

## [Thematic heading for: Complaints and Follow-up]

- The core argument: what the government should have done differently
- Specific recommendations:
  - What actions should the government take?
  - What should lawmakers follow up on?
  - What accountability measures should be in place?
- Frame this as a complaint to the LegCo Public Complaints Office
  - See `week5/LegcoComplaint.md` for how the Redress System works

---

## [Thematic heading for: Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage]

- What angles would interest journalists?
- What questions should the media investigate further?
- Draft a letter to the editor (e.g. SCMP) as an abridged way to express your views
  - 300–400 words
  - One clear argument
  - Supported by 2–3 pieces of evidence
- How can media coverage create pressure for government accountability?
