## Summary
This official Hong Kong government document from June 2024 details the Administration's written reply to a Legislative Council question regarding support for rare disease patients, specifically addressing issues around expensive drug accessibility and subsidies. In response to a query about relaxing the age limit for subsidizing Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) drugs Nusinersen and Risdiplam, the Hospital Authority (HA) states that the current subsidy through the Community Care Fund is not extended to adult patients over 25, citing limited clinical evidence of significant efficacy for this age group and aligning with international practices. Since 2017, the special program has approved subsidies for 80 Nusinersen applications (totaling HK$183.54 million) and 47 Risdiplam applications (HK$74.19 million) for eligible patients, with the HA's expert panel committed to continuously reviewing clinical evidence and subsidy parameters.

## Key Statistics (as of March 31, 2024)
- **Nusinersen for SMA**: 80 approved applications, HK$183.54 million in subsidies
- **Risdiplam for SMA**: 47 approved applications, HK$74.19 million in subsidies
- **Age Restriction**: Subsidy only available for patients under 25 years old
- **Rationale**: Limited clinical evidence for efficacy in adult patients, consistent with international practices

## Additional Context from Full Article

### Ultra-Expensive Drugs Programme Coverage
The Community Care Fund Medical Assistance Programme covers 12 ultra-expensive drugs including:
1. Eculizumab for blood disorders (73 applications, HK$274.83M)
2. Nusinersen for SMA (80 applications, HK$183.54M)
3. Risdiplam for SMA (47 applications, HK$74.19M)
4. Various other treatments for rare diseases

### Rare Disease Database Development
- HA is building databases for 207 uncommon disorders
- Currently tracking 35 uncommon disorders (25 metabolic, 4 neurological, 6 endocrine)
- Progressive expansion of patient information systems

### Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) Programme
Designated funding for lysosomal storage disorders:
- 2021-22: 40 patients, HK$82.5M
- 2022-23: 50 patients, HK$99.7M
- 2023-24: 59 patients, HK$115.9M

### Key Policy Issues Addressed
1. **Age limit for SMA drugs**: Not relaxed due to limited efficacy evidence for adults over 25
2. **Cross-border drug procurement**: Government exploring but no specific commitments
3. **Greater Bay Area pilot**: Does not specifically target rare disease patients
4. **New drug registration**: "1+" mechanism facilitates faster approval for life-threatening conditions

## Government Position
- Evidence-based approach to drug approval and subsidies
- Balancing patient needs with financial sustainability
- Continuous review of clinical evidence and international practices
- Building comprehensive rare disease databases for better targeted support
