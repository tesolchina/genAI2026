1. Carrie Lam promises to ‘personally’ ensure life-saving drug for Hong Kong patients with spinal muscular atrophy | South China Morning Post






Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam met with rare disease patients protesting outside her office and made a personal promise to help. She specifically pledged to try to secure access to a potentially life-saving new drug called nusinersen for 23-year-old Josy Chow, who has spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).


Lam stated the issue was not about money, but that the U.S. drug manufacturer had no current plans to introduce the medicine in Hong Kong. She directed her food and health secretary to negotiate with the drug maker and promised the government would fight for compassionate arrangements to help the patients. This case highlighted challenges in Hong Kong's drug registration system.

The 2012 SCMP article highlights the critical reliance of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients in Hong Kong on spare medical equipment provided by the Families of SMA Charitable Trust, focusing on a mother's experience where a life-sustaining cough-assist machine for her six-year-old daughter malfunctioned and was urgently replaced by the trust, underscoring the vital, immediate need for such backup support as the specialized and expensive machines are not readily available for quick purchase, preventing hospitalization during breakdowns.

The article reports on Marcus Ng, a 10-year-old boy in Hong Kong with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a disorder causing severe muscle weakness. With only 10% of normal lung function, he faces a high-risk spinal surgery to correct scoliosis and improve his breathing. His family acknowledges the dangers but sees the operation as necessary to stop his health from deteriorating further.

This official Hong Kong government document from June 2024 details the Administration's written reply to a Legislative Council question regarding support for rare disease patients, specifically addressing issues around expensive drug accessibility and subsidies, where in response to a query about relaxing the age limit for subsidizing Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) drugs Nusinersen and Risdiplam, the Hospital Authority (HA) states that the current subsidy through the Community Care Fund is not extended to adult patients over 25, citing limited clinical evidence of significant efficacy for this age group and aligning with international practices, while also reporting that since 2017, the special program has approved subsidies for 80 Nusinersen applications (totaling HK$183.54 million) and 47 Risdiplam applications(HK$74.19 million) for eligible patients, with the HA's expert panel committed to continuously reviewing clinical evidence and subsidy parameters.
