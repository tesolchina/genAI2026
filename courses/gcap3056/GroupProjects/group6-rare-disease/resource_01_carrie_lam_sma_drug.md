## Summary
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam met with rare disease patients protesting outside her office and made a personal promise to help. She specifically pledged to try to secure access to a potentially life-saving new drug called nusinersen for 23-year-old Josy Chow, who has spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

Lam stated the issue was not about money, but that the U.S. drug manufacturer had no current plans to introduce the medicine in Hong Kong. She directed her food and health secretary to negotiate with the drug maker and promised the government would fight for compassionate arrangements to help the patients. This case highlighted challenges in Hong Kong's drug registration system.
