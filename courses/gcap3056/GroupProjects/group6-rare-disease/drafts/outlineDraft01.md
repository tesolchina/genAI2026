# Draft Report Outline 01: Rare Disease Healthcare Support in Hong Kong

**Based on:** `outlineDraft.md`  
**Updated:** 12 Feb 2026  
**Project focus:** How Hong Kong can work with Mainland China to enhance access to medicine for rare disease.

## Title (placeholder)
- The Price of Rarity: Why Hong Kong Must Rethink Its Approach to Rare Disease Drug Access

## Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- Key point: Hong Kong's rare disease patients face prohibitive drug costs and limited access compared to Mainland China and other jurisdictions; the government should explore Mainland procurement, reference pricing, and expanded age limits for drug subsidies

## Background: The Problem
- Rare disease patients in Hong Kong face extremely high drug costs (e.g. SMA drug nusinersen)
- The Hospital Authority formulary and "1+" mechanism determine which drugs are subsidised
- SMA drug subsidy had an **age limit of 25**; **as of Jul 2025**, expansion of subsidy eligibility to adult SMA patients was approved (RTHK; implementation targeted by end 2025)
- Drug prices in Hong Kong are significantly higher than in Mainland China (e.g. ~5% of HK prices in Mainland; LegCo IN13/2025: HK$36,000 vs HK$4,000 per month in one comparison)
- Carrie Lam made promises on SMA drug access for patient Josy Chow; progress has been limited
- Marcus Ng (10-year-old) facing high-risk spinal surgery highlights the human cost

## Existing Solution
- Hospital Authority drug formulary system
- "1+" mechanism (extended to all new drugs Nov 2024); first advanced therapy product approved under "1+" (Nov 2025)
- Community Care Fund and Samaritan Fund for financial assistance
- Government subsidies for specific SMA treatments (age limit under review; adult expansion in progress)
- Families of SMA Charitable Trust advocacy
- GBA cooperation: clinical trials, HK–Shenzhen centre for real-world data to fast-track Mainland approval (not HA procurement from Mainland)

## Room for Improvement
- **Hypothesis 1 (primary):** The government could explore **joint procurement with Mainland China** or reference pricing to reduce drug costs for rare disease patients
- **Hypothesis 2:** The **SMA subsidy age limit** should be expanded and kept under review (partially addressed by 2025 adult expansion)
- **Hypothesis 3:** The government should provide **better guidance and support** for patients seeking to obtain drugs from Mainland China
- **Hypothesis 4:** Drug price **transparency** needs improvement — reference Mainland practice of publishing official drug price lists (LCQ22 Oct 2025)
- Reference: `hypotheses.md`, `HypotheseQuestions.md` (in this folder)

## Government's Replies to Our Enquiries
- **Ten questions** with target HK government units: see `govEnquiries.md` (this folder)
- **Six core questions** (see `HypotheseQuestions.md` in this folder): (1) Policy on HA procuring from Mainland; (2) Feasibility assessment on joint procurement/reference pricing; (3) Hurdles; (4) Pilot schemes; (5) Guidance for patients obtaining drugs from Mainland; (6) Data on patients obtaining rare disease drugs from Mainland
- **Suggested addressees:** Health Bureau; Hospital Authority (e.g. via Code on Access to Information or LegCo question)
- Anticipated: government may cite regulatory differences or drug approval regimes as barriers
- [Insert summary of actual replies once received]

## Recommendations (to be refined after government replies)
1. **Feasibility study:** Government should commission a formal feasibility study on joint procurement or reference pricing with the Mainland for a defined list of ultra-expensive rare disease drugs, while preserving quality and regulatory standards.
2. **SMA subsidy:** Maintain and implement the expansion of SMA drug subsidy to adult patients; keep evidence under regular review.
3. **Transparency:** Publish public hospital drug prices (or a reference list) for key rare disease and cancer drugs, with reference to Mainland practice where appropriate (per LCQ22 Oct 2025).
4. **Patient support:** Provide clear information and, where feasible, referral or continuity-of-care support for patients who legally obtain drugs from the Mainland.

## Complaints and Follow-up
- [To be developed based on government replies]
- If the government has not seriously explored Mainland procurement, lawmakers should push for a formal feasibility study
- Track implementation of SMA adult subsidy expansion (end 2025)

## Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage
- **Angle:** "Same drug, vastly different prices — why do Hong Kong patients pay more for rare disease treatment than Mainland counterparts?"
- Compare drug pricing: HK vs Mainland vs other jurisdictions
- Potential letter to the editor (SCMP) on rare disease drug pricing and access
