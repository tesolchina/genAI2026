we need to formulate some hypothese based on docs found 

one possible focus is on how HK government could work with the Mainland authories on procuring and securing rare disease drugs 

hypothesis would be that more partnership could benefit the patients but there are administrative and political hurdles that could be overcome with sufficient political will 

create a HypotheseQuestions.md to explore the hypothese and raise questions for the government staff; anticipate possible answers how these answers can help; also be prepared for little info provided 

make reference to docs already available
