# Comment on Progress (12 Feb) — Group 6 Rare Disease

**Project:** Healthcare support for patients with rare diseases in Hong Kong  
**Focus:** How Hong Kong can work with Mainland China to enhance access to medicine for rare disease.

## 1. What the Google Doc and project materials show

- **Public info curation (Google Doc):** The 15-tab structure covers media (SCMP), government replies (LCQ16, LCQ21, etc.), HKCH patient information, and Policy Address 2025. This gives a clear evidence base for SMA, subsidy limits, and the government’s stance on Mainland procurement.
- **Hypotheses:** A main focus is set: **Mainland procurement vs independent drug regime** (exploring joint procurement, reference pricing, or conditional procurement with the Mainland). Alternatives are documented: SMA age limit (Option B), speed of access / "1+" (Option C), support for patients obtaining drugs in Mainland (Option D), and transparency (Option E).
- **Questions for government:** Six questions are drafted in `HypotheseQuestions.md` (policy on HA procuring from Mainland; feasibility assessment; hurdles; pilot schemes; guidance for patients; data on patients obtaining drugs from Mainland). These are suitable for Code on Access to Information or similar.
- **Supporting docs:** `summary2Feb.md`, `moreDocs.md`, `WebSearchReport.md`, and `AIwebsearch/AIsearchReport.md` extend the Doc with extra LegCo replies (e.g. LCQ5 Sep 2025, LCQ22 Oct 2025), SCMP/Straits Times articles, and thematic summaries. The outline in `outlineDraft.md` ties background, hypotheses, government enquiries, and media angles together.

## 2. Strengths

- **Clear focus:** HK–Mainland cooperation for rare disease drug access is a concrete, policy-relevant focus with a testable hypothesis.
- **Use of official sources:** LCQ16 (Jun 2024) and related replies are used to state the current “do not encourage” position and the ~5% price comparison; this is good for credibility.
- **Structured alternatives:** Options B–E allow the group to adjust emphasis (e.g. if government replies are thin on procurement) without losing the thread.
- **Actionable questions:** The six questions are specific and linked to the hypothesis; they support a short report and possible follow-up (e.g. LegCo submission or media piece).

## 3. Gaps and issues to address

- **Google Doc vs local files:** The live Google Doc could have new tabs or edits. Sync regularly: re-export or copy new content into `google_doc_content.txt` and update `GoogleNotes.md` and `summary2Feb.md` so the teacher and AI work from the same “latest” version.
- **One clear “ask”:** The report will be stronger if it ends with one or two concrete recommendations (e.g. “Government should commission a feasibility study on joint procurement or reference pricing with the Mainland for a defined list of ultra-expensive rare disease drugs” and “Review the SMA subsidy age limit in light of Mainland practice and updated evidence”). The outline can reserve a short “Recommendations” subsection for this.
- **Government enquiries:** The six questions are ready to send. Decide which bureau/department to approach (e.g. Health Bureau, HA, or both) and whether to use Code on Access to Information; then send and record the request and reply in the report.
- **Media angle:** The suggested angle (“Same drug, vastly different prices”) is strong. One next step is to collect exact drug-by-drug or case-by-case price comparisons (HK vs Mainland) from public sources or patient groups, to support the narrative.

## 4. Suggested next steps

1. **Confirm focus with teacher:** In the Google Doc or Moodle, confirm that the primary focus remains “HK–Mainland cooperation to enhance access to rare disease medicine” and that the six questions in `HypotheseQuestions.md` are the ones to pursue.
2. **Send government enquiries:** Choose the appropriate HK government unit(s), send the questions (e.g. via Code on Access to Information), and log the request date and reference number. Use replies (or non-replies) in `commentonProgress12Feb.md` and in the final report.
3. **Update outline to outlineDraft01.md:** Add a short “Recommendations” section (1–2 concrete asks), ensure “Government’s Replies to Our Enquiries” references the six questions and the chosen HK units, and add a “References” list that includes `latestOnlineDocs.md` and any new articles.
4. **Add new articles:** Use `latestOnlineDocs.md` (and any further search) to add recent, relevant articles to the Google Doc (new tab or “Further sources” section) so the report reflects the latest policy and media coverage.
5. **Student feedback:** Use `seekFeedback13Feb.md` so the team can comment on the work (e.g. in a new Google Doc tab) and submit to Moodle when instructed.
6. **Reorganise folder:** Move existing and new docs into logical subfolders (e.g. `docs/`, `sources/`, `drafts/`, `instructions/`) so the project folder is easier to navigate and hand over.

## 5. Focus and issues the student may wish to pursue

- **Deepening the procurement argument:** Whether any jurisdiction with an independent drug regime has allowed conditional procurement from a neighbouring market; whether HA has ever assessed feasibility of joint or reference-price cooperation with the Mainland.
- **SMA age limit:** Tracking international guidelines and real-world data on adult SMA treatment; comparing with Mainland (no age limit) and asking for a review of the age-25 cap.
- **Patient voice:** Incorporating patient/carer perspectives (e.g. from Families of SMA Charitable Trust or similar) on cost, access, and experience of obtaining drugs from the Mainland, if the group can do so within the project scope.
- **Timeline:** Agreeing a deadline for sending government enquiries and for drafting the first full report so that government replies can be integrated.
