# Draft Report Outline: Rare Disease Healthcare Support in Hong Kong

## Title (placeholder)
- The Price of Rarity: Why Hong Kong Must Rethink Its Approach to Rare Disease Drug Access

## Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- Key point: Hong Kong's rare disease patients face prohibitive drug costs and limited access compared to Mainland China and other jurisdictions; the government should explore Mainland procurement, reference pricing, and expanded age limits for drug subsidies

## Background: The Problem
- Rare disease patients in Hong Kong face extremely high drug costs (e.g. SMA drug nusinersen)
- The Hospital Authority formulary and "1+" mechanism determine which drugs are subsidised
- SMA drug subsidy has an **age limit of 25**, excluding older patients
- Drug prices in Hong Kong are significantly higher than in Mainland China
- Carrie Lam made promises on SMA drug access for patient Josy Chow; progress has been limited
- Marcus Ng (10-year-old) facing high-risk spinal surgery highlights the human cost
- Reference: `WebSearchReport.md`, `AIwebsearch/AIsearchReport.md`, `summary2Feb.md`

## Existing Solution
- Hospital Authority drug formulary system
- "1+" mechanism for self-financed items
- Community Care Fund and Samaritan Fund for financial assistance
- Government subsidies for specific SMA treatments (with age limit)
- Families of SMA Charitable Trust advocacy

## Room for Improvement
- **Hypothesis 1 (primary):** The government could explore **joint procurement with Mainland China** or reference pricing to reduce drug costs for rare disease patients
- **Hypothesis 2:** The **SMA subsidy age limit of 25** is arbitrary and should be expanded
- **Hypothesis 3:** The government should provide **better guidance and support** for patients seeking to obtain drugs from Mainland China
- **Hypothesis 4:** Drug price **transparency** needs improvement — patients cannot easily compare costs across jurisdictions
- Reference: `hypotheses.md`, `HypotheseQuestions.md`

## Government's Replies to Our Enquiries
- [Placeholder — questions sent under Code on Access to Information]
- **Six questions already formulated** (see `HypotheseQuestions.md`):
  1. What is the current government policy on HA procuring drugs from Mainland China?
  2. Has any feasibility assessment been conducted on joint procurement or reference pricing?
  3. What are the main hurdles preventing such procurement arrangements?
  4. Has any pilot scheme been considered for specific drugs (e.g. SMA treatments)?
  5. What guidance does the government provide for patients obtaining drugs from Mainland China?
  6. How many Hong Kong patients are currently obtaining rare disease drugs from the Mainland?
- Anticipated: government may cite regulatory differences or drug approval regimes as barriers

## Complaints and Follow-up
- [Placeholder — to be developed based on government replies]
- If the government has not seriously explored Mainland procurement, lawmakers should push for a formal feasibility study
- The age limit of 25 for SMA subsidies should be reviewed with clinical evidence

## Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage
- **Angle:** "Same drug, vastly different prices — why do Hong Kong patients pay more for rare disease treatment than Mainland counterparts?"
- Compare drug pricing: HK vs Mainland vs other jurisdictions
- Potential letter to the editor (SCMP) on rare disease drug pricing and access
