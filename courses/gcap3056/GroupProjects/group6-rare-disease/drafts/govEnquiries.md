# Government Enquiries — 10 Questions for HK Government

**Project:** Group 6 — Healthcare support for patients with rare diseases in Hong Kong  
**Focus:** How Hong Kong can work with Mainland China to enhance access to medicine for rare disease.  
**Use:** Code on Access to Information, or LegCo written question; adapt wording as needed.  
**Limit:** 10 questions. Each entry states the question, why it is relevant, and which HK government unit/team should answer.

---

## 1. Policy on HA procuring drugs from the Mainland

**Question:** What is the Government’s current policy on the Hospital Authority procuring drugs (including rare disease drugs) from the Mainland or participating in the Mainland’s drug procurement mechanism? Please provide any internal guidelines or criteria that set out this position.

**Why relevant:** LCQ16 (Jun 2024) states the Government does not encourage HA to procure from the Mainland. We need a clear, citable statement of policy and any internal criteria to assess whether the stance could be refined (e.g. conditional procurement for specific drugs).

**HK unit to answer:** **Health Bureau** (policy); **Hospital Authority** may be asked to provide operational context. Prefer Health Bureau as lead for policy wording.

---

## 2. Feasibility assessment on joint procurement or reference pricing

**Question:** Beyond the reasons already given in the reply to LCQ16 (June 2024), has the Government or the HA conducted any assessment of the feasibility of joint procurement, reference pricing, or conditional procurement with the Mainland for specific ultra-expensive or rare disease drugs? If yes, please provide the scope and conclusions (or a summary). If no, please confirm and state whether any such assessment is planned.

**Why relevant:** If no assessment has been done, the report can recommend one; if one exists, we can cite it and discuss conclusions. Directly tests the main hypothesis.

**HK unit to answer:** **Health Bureau** (policy and coordination); **Hospital Authority** (procurement practice). Either can respond; HA may hold any internal feasibility work.

---

## 3. Hurdles to procuring from the Mainland or using Mainland prices

**Question:** What specific administrative, regulatory, or legal hurdles does the Government consider would need to be addressed before the HA could procure certain drugs from the Mainland (or use Mainland prices as a reference in negotiations), while maintaining quality and safety standards?

**Why relevant:** Understanding official hurdles allows the report to discuss whether they could be overcome with political will and to compare with other jurisdictions.

**HK unit to answer:** **Health Bureau** (regulatory and policy); **Department of Health** (Drug Office) for registration and standards; **Hospital Authority** for procurement rules.

---

## 4. Pilot schemes for Mainland procurement or pricing cooperation

**Question:** Has the Government considered or explored any pilot schemes (e.g. for a defined list of rare disease or high-cost drugs) to test cooperation with Mainland authorities on procurement or pricing, without changing the principle of primary evaluation in Hong Kong? If yes, please describe. If no, please state whether this is under consideration.

**Why relevant:** Shows whether targeted engagement is on the policy agenda; supports a concrete recommendation (e.g. recommend a pilot) if the answer is no.

**HK unit to answer:** **Health Bureau** (policy); **Hospital Authority** (implementation).

---

## 5. Guidance for patients obtaining drugs from the Mainland

**Question:** What guidance or information does the Government or the HA provide to rare disease patients who are considering or already obtaining drugs from the Mainland (e.g. via Named Patient Programme or personal purchase)? Is there any referral or follow-up arrangement with Mainland hospitals for such patients?

**Why relevant:** Addresses Option D (support for patients who obtain drugs in the Mainland). A gap in guidance supports recommending better information and continuity of care.

**HK unit to answer:** **Health Bureau** (policy); **Hospital Authority** (patient services, HA hospitals). HA is best placed for day-to-day guidance.

---

## 6. Data on patients obtaining rare disease drugs from the Mainland

**Question:** In LCQ16 (June 2024) it was stated that some patients buy drugs from the Mainland at around 5% of HK public hospital prices. Does the Government collect or estimate data on how many rare disease patients obtain drugs from the Mainland? If so, please provide a summary. If not, please state the reason.

**Why relevant:** Scale of “northbound” drug access informs the case for policy change; if no data are collected, we can recommend data collection.

**HK unit to answer:** **Health Bureau** (policy and cross-boundary coordination); **Hospital Authority** (if any data from HA patients). Health Bureau as lead.

---

## 7. SMA drug subsidy age limit and adult eligibility

**Question:** What is the current eligibility criteria and age limit (if any) for the Community Care Fund subsidy for Nusinersen and Risdiplam (SMA)? Please confirm the timeline for extending subsidy to adult SMA patients (as reported in July 2025) and the evidence base for the change.

**Why relevant:** The age limit of 25 was a major barrier; expansion to adults was announced (RTHK Jul 2025). We need official confirmation and timeline for the report.

**HK unit to answer:** **Health Bureau** (CCF policy); **Hospital Authority** (administration of CCF Ultra-expensive Drugs Programme, clinical criteria). HA often answers operational detail.

---

## 8. Drug price transparency and reference to Mainland price lists

**Question:** In LCQ22 (October 2025) it was asked whether the Government would reference the Mainland’s practice of publishing official anti-cancer and rare disease drug price lists online to promote drug price transparency in Hong Kong’s public hospitals. What is the Government’s response and any plan to publish HA drug prices or a reference list for key rare disease and cancer drugs?

**Why relevant:** Transparency is a strand of the report (Option E) and was raised in LegCo; official response informs recommendations.

**HK unit to answer:** **Health Bureau** (policy); **Hospital Authority** (formulary and pricing data). Health Bureau for policy response; HA for feasibility of publication.

---

## 9. Named Patient Programme and introduction of Mainland drugs

**Question:** What are the main obstacles to patients or doctors using the Named Patient Programme (NPP) to introduce drugs from the Mainland for use in Hong Kong (e.g. procedures, approval time, prepayment)? Is the Government considering simplifying the NPP or facilitating access for specific rare disease drugs?

**Why relevant:** LCQ8 (Dec 2024) cited cumbersome procedures and long approval. Understanding obstacles supports recommendations on NPP or alternative pathways.

**HK unit to answer:** **Department of Health** (Drug Office — NPP and drug registration); **Health Bureau** (policy). Drug Office is the operational lead.

---

## 10. HA Cost Assessment Panel and use of reference pricing

**Question:** The Hospital Authority has established a Cost Assessment Panel to enhance cost control in negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. Does the Panel use or consider Mainland drug prices (or prices in other jurisdictions) as a reference when assessing ultra-expensive or rare disease drugs? If not, please state the reason and whether this is under consideration.

**Why relevant:** Directly tests whether “reference pricing” (including Mainland) is used in practice; if not, we can recommend it as a low-risk step.

**HK unit to answer:** **Hospital Authority** (procurement and Cost Assessment Panel). HA is the only appropriate body.
