we want to focus on the mechanism of FSD in learning from the past fire incidents (abroad and in Mainland)

two key questions 
should the FSD staff be blamed for "failing" to learn from Lonon and other similar incidents before Tai Po fire? Is Tai Po fire prevetable (should there be a stronger mechanism and effort to learn from the past incidents and apply the lessons here in HK)

in what ways can FSD learn from the past incidents that might carry lessons (unrelated to Tai Po fire) which could help prevent major fire incidents in HK in future 


based on the two questions and review all notes genai2026/courses/gcap3056/GroupProjects/group2-fire-service-1/ and create a how_to_learn_lessons.md with clickable links, in bullet points 

also update the outline for Legco report and create outlineDraft01.md based on genai2026/courses/gcap3056/GroupProjects/group2-fire-service-1/outlineDraft.md

create govEnquiry.md to raise questions for FSD to gather more info that is not publicly available 

create a log to document what has been done 

commit and push all changes to github
