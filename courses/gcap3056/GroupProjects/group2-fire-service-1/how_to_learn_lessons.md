# How Can the FSD Learn Lessons from Past Fire Incidents?

**Project:** Group 2 — Fire Service 1  
**Focus:** The mechanism of FSD in learning from past fire incidents (abroad and in Mainland)  
**Date:** 12 Feb 2026 (updated with cross-referenced data from Group 4 — Fire Service 2)

---

## Two Key Questions

### Question 1: Should the FSD be blamed for "failing" to learn from London Grenfell and other similar incidents before the Tai Po fire? Was the Tai Po fire preventable?

### Question 2: In what ways can FSD learn from past incidents (not limited to Tai Po fire) that might carry lessons to help prevent major fire incidents in HK in the future?

---

## Question 1: Was the Tai Po Fire Preventable?

### The Tai Po (Wang Fuk Court) Fire — Key Facts

- **Date:** 26 Nov 2025, 2:51 PM; **Location:** Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po
- **Final death toll: 168** (confirmed 16 Jan 2026 by Security Secretary Chris Tang) — [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w9wqek3jo.amp) | [Reuters comparison](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-does-hong-kong-tower-fire-compare-other-recent-building-blazes-2025-11-28/)
- **Scale:** 7 of 8 31-storey towers engulfed; fire took **40+ hours** to extinguish; Hong Kong's deadliest blaze in decades
- **Victims:** Aged 6 months to 98 years; 58 male, 110 female; **nearly 40% of residents were 65+**; 10 domestic workers, 5 construction workers, 1 firefighter (Ho Wai-ho, 37) among dead
- **Cause:** External fire fuelled by combustible renovation materials — bamboo scaffolding and protective netting creating a "chimney effect" up the façade ([Caixin analysis](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2025-11-27/analysis-hong-kong-fire-exposed-fatal-gap-in-high-rise-safety-doctrine-102387561.html))
- **Contributing factors:**
  - **2,300 rolls** of cheaper, non-fire-retardant netting purchased after typhoon damage (Jul 2025) to replace compliant netting — compliant netting only installed at base where samples were taken ([IFSJ](https://internationalfireandsafetyjournal.com/wang-fuk-court-fire-lessons/))
  - **7 of 20 netting samples** from near windows/higher locations failed fire safety tests
  - Foam/styrofoam boards sealed windows — **residents warned about flammability as early as Sep 2024** (a board ignited rapidly when exposed to a cigarette lighter in front of residents and project reps)
  - Tower spacing ~7.5m, reduced further by scaffolding, enabled tower-to-tower spread
  - **Fire alarms in ALL 8 blocks did not sound** — systems deactivated or malfunctioning during renovation; fire service installation contractor staff arrested for deactivating alarms and making false statements to FSD ([SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3334567/failure-fire-alarms-tai-po-could-have-delayed-rescue-cost-lives-says-expert))
  - Video evidence showed residents **unsuccessfully trying to activate manual call points**; many only learned of fire when contacted by phone by family members
  - HK$330 million renovation project dating back to 2016 ([HKFP timeline](https://hongkongfp.com/2025/12/17/tai-po-fire-timeline-wang-fuk-courts-hk330-million-renovation-ignored-warnings-and-aftermath/))
  - Residents filed complaints with **ICAC**, **Labour Department**, and **Housing Bureau's Independent Checking Unit**
  - **16 inspections** between Jul 2024 and Nov 2025 failed to prevent the disaster
  - Labour Department issued further fire safety warning on **20 Nov 2025** — just 6 days before the fire
  - Inspectors accepted documents indicating netting compliance based on **ground-level samples only**
- **Arrests:** 30+ people arrested for manslaughter, fraud, corruption — including engineering consultants, construction directors, scaffolding subcontractors, and fire service contractors; ICAC investigating netting procurement corruption
- **Emergency Alert System (EAS) was NOT activated** during the fire — the HK$150M system has been used only **once** since its 2020 launch (COVID-19 hospital notification, Mar 2022) ([Wikipedia/OFCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Emergency_Alert_System))

### What lessons from Grenfell were available BEFORE Tai Po?

The London Grenfell Tower fire (14 June 2017, 72 deaths) offered these lessons, all publicly available years before Tai Po:

- **Combustible cladding/external materials** were the primary cause of fire spread at Grenfell ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40301289))
  - The aluminium composite material (ACM) with polyethylene core melted, dripped, and flowed at elevated temperature
  - Vertical cavities within the cladding structure played a role in fire spread
  - The UK subsequently removed similar cladding from thousands of buildings
- **"Stay put" policy failed** when external fire spread made it impossible to contain fire to one flat ([London Museum](https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/grenfell-tower-fire/))
- **Fire alarms and smoke extraction systems failed** — smoke extraction was not working; no wet riser for water supply
- **Residents' complaints were ignored** — the Grenfell Action Group warned in 2016: *"Only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord"*
- **Substandard materials and inadequate supervision** — cladding had failed fire safety tests before installation; manufacturers hid findings
- **No evacuation plan** — firefighters were not prepared; no specific plan for evacuating the tower
- **TMO showed "persistent indifference"** to fire safety — inquiry found systemic failures in management

### Parallels between Grenfell and Tai Po

| Factor | Grenfell (2017) | Tai Po (2025) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| External combustible materials | ACM cladding with polyethylene core | Scaffolding nets, foam board, tarpaulins |
| "Chimney effect" / rapid spread | Fire spread via cladding cavities | Fire spread via scaffolding and netting |
| Residents' warnings ignored | Grenfell Action Group complaints (2016) | Complaints to ICAC, Labour Dept, Housing Bureau; 16 inspections failed to act |
| Fire alarm failure | Smoke extraction not working | Alarms in ALL 8 blocks deactivated/malfunctioning; contractors arrested for false reporting |
| Substandard materials | Failed fire safety tests; manufacturers hid findings | 7 of 20 samples failed; 2,300 rolls of non-compliant netting substituted |
| Renovation-related | 2010s cladding refurbishment | HK$330 million façade renovation (since 2016) |
| Emergency alert gap | No dynamic "evacuate now" broadcast | HK$150M EAS not activated; used only once since 2020 |
| Death toll | 72 | 168 (final, confirmed Jan 2026) |
| Vulnerable residents | Council housing tenants | 40% aged 65+; ~4,600 residents; built 1980s |

### Assessment: Was FSD's failure to learn from Grenfell a factor?

- **The pattern was known:** External combustible materials on building façades causing rapid fire spread was a well-documented risk after Grenfell
- **The gap:** Hong Kong did not appear to have applied Grenfell's lessons to regulate combustible renovation materials (scaffolding nets, foam boards) on building façades during renovation works
- **The question for FSD:** Did the FSD study the Grenfell fire? If so, what specific policy or procedural changes were made? Did those changes address external façade fire risks during renovation works?
- **Note on accountability:** Hong Kong's swift response (30+ arrests) contrasts with Grenfell's 7+ year wait for prosecution ([China Daily](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/625217))

### Investigation and Independent Committee

- **Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force** established Nov 2025, led by FSD — includes Police, BD, EMSD, Housing Bureau, Labour Dept, Government Lab, fire engineers ([news.gov.hk](https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2025/11/20251129/20251129_143248_032.html))
- **Independent Committee** established 12 Dec 2025 — chaired by Justice David Lok; members: Chan Kin-por (ExCo/LegCo) and Dr Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen (MTR Chairman) ([gov press release](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200786.htm))
  - Terms of reference cover: fire causes, fire service installations, construction safety, materials standards, roles and responsibilities, systemic problems, bid-rigging corruption, adequacy of regulation
  - Target: 9 months from late Dec 2025
- **First meeting (5 Feb 2026):** Senior counsel Victor Dawes stated "evidence appears to show a series of **systemic problems that should not be neglected and are unacceptable**" ([SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3342448/fairness-pledged-hong-kong-residents-seek-answers-tai-po-fire-inquiry))
- **Public hearings scheduled March 2026** ([The Standard](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/hong-kong-news/article/321075/Independent-Committee-probing-Wang-Fuk-Court-fire-to-hold-hearings-in-March-sources))

### Hong Kong's 30-Year Pattern: 7 Major Fires

The Tai Po fire fits a recurring pattern of deadly fires in Hong Kong over 30 years ([Storm.mg review](https://www.storm.mg/lifestyle/11084096)):

| # | Fire | Year | Deaths | Key Issue |
|---|------|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Garley House, Jordan (Level 5) | 1996 | 41 | Sparks from welding during elevator replacement |
| 2 | TST Karaoke Arson | 1997 | 17 | Triad revenge; petrol bomb |
| 3 | Golden Harvest Building, Mong Kok (Level 5) | 2008 | 4 | Nightclub fire; rapid spread |
| 4 | Fa Yuen Street, Mong Kok (Level 4) | 2011 | 9 | Ground-floor food stalls; spread to old tenement |
| 5 | Ngau Tau Kok Mini Storage (Level 4) | 2016 | 2 | Flammable goods; 108+ hours |
| 6 | Canton Road, Yau Ma Tei | 2020 | 7–8 | Tent house; Level 1 but still deadly |
| 7 | **Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po (Level 5)** | **2025** | **168** | **Non-compliant netting; scaffolding; alarms off** |

**Core recurring risks:** Potential fire sources and flammable materials in construction projects; complex defects of old buildings (tenement/subdivided flats, mixed-use); inadequate fire safety systems.

## Question 2: How Can FSD Learn from Past Incidents to Prevent Future Major Fires?

### A. Lessons from International Incidents

#### 1. London Grenfell Tower (2017) — UK
- **Key lesson:** Ban combustible cladding; retrofit existing buildings; enforce fire safety in renovations
- **What UK did:** Public inquiry → 1,700-page report (Sep 2024); removed similar cladding from thousands of buildings; new building safety regulations
- **What HK should learn:** Systematic review of all external materials on existing buildings; ban non-fire-retardant renovation materials
- **Source:** [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40301289) | [London Museum](https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/grenfell-tower-fire/)

#### 2. Mainland China — National Inspection Campaign (2025)
- **Key lesson:** Proactive, nationwide response to fire risks in high-rise buildings
- **What Mainland did after Tai Po:** Launched national inspection campaign on 29 Nov 2025 focusing on:
  - High-rise buildings undergoing external/internal wall renovations
  - Verification of prohibited materials (bamboo scaffolding, non-fire resistant safety nets)
  - Testing of fire hydrants, water sprinklers, and alarm systems
  - Prevention of maintenance failures in aging fire safety infrastructure
- **Context:** China's 2023 data showed 23,000 high-rise fires (35% increase from 2022); external insulation materials identified as major contributing factor
- **What HK should learn:** Regular, proactive fire safety inspections of renovation sites; not just reactive after incidents
- **Source:** [Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/concern-raised-in-china-over-fire-hazards-in-tall-buildings-after-deadly-hong-kong-fire)

#### 3. Global Lessons for High-Rise Safety
- **Key lesson:** External fire risk during renovation is a known global hazard
- **What HK should learn:** Adopt international standards for flame-retardant scaffolding materials; fire safety oversight of renovation works
- **Source:** [International Fire & Safety Journal](https://internationalfireandsafetyjournal.com/wang-fuk-court-fire-lessons/)

### B. Lessons from Local Incidents (Hong Kong)

#### 4. Jordan Fire — New Lucky House (Apr 2024)
- **Key lesson:** Old composite buildings with uncomplied Fire Safety Directions are ticking time bombs
- **What happened:** No. 3 alarm fire; 5 dead, 35 injured; 16-storey building (1964); Fire Safety Direction issued 2008 but not complied; 2023 repair tender still in preparation
- **FSD response:** Formed dedicated team; proactive inspections of ~1,000 old composite buildings; 8,661 notices issued; over half related to smoke stop door irregularities
- **Lesson for FSD:** Enforcement of Fire Safety Directions must have a real deadline and real consequences for non-compliance
- **Source:** [Info.gov.hk CE statement](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202404/10/P2024041000356.htm) | [BD inspection](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202404/11/P2024041100013.htm)

#### 5. FSD IT Data Breach (May 2024)
- **Key lesson:** FSD's internal IT systems are vulnerable; contractor oversight is weak
- **What happened:** Potential personal data leakage during contractor data migration; ~480 members of public + ~5,000 FSD members affected
- **Lesson for FSD:** Modernize IT systems; tighter contractor access controls; ensure alert/reporting systems are resilient
- **Source:** [Info.gov.hk](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202405/06/P2024050600687.htm) | [SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3261641/hong-kong-fire-service-reports-potential-leak-personal-data-5000-staff-members-public)

#### 6. Typhoon Saola Tree Collapse Reports (Sep 2023)
- **Key lesson:** FSD's public reporting and alert systems must cope with extreme events
- **What happened:** 1,545+ fallen trees; 86+ hospitalised; high volume of public reports to FSD
- **Lesson for FSD:** Stress-test reporting and alert systems for extreme events; ensure data systems can handle surges
- **Source:** [SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3233189/typhoon-saola-aftermath-hong-kong-wakes-debris-and-fallen-trees-roads-damage-not-bad-feared)

### C. FSD's Existing Mechanisms for Learning — and Gaps

#### What FSD currently does:
- **Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force** — led by FSD, includes Police, BD, EMSD, Housing Bureau, Labour Dept, Government Lab, fire engineers ([news.gov.hk](https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2025/11/20251129/20251129_143248_032.html))
- **Performance Pledge** — building fire response: 6 min (92.5% target; 95.6% achieved 2024) ([FSD Performance Pledge](https://www.hkfsd.gov.hk/eng/aboutus/performance.html))
- **Year-end Review** — annual public review of performance metrics ([Year-end Review 2024](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202501/22/P2025012200234p.htm))
- **Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance** — amended Dec 2024 with defaulted works mechanism and increased penalties
- **One-stop Coordination Office** for new fire protection facilities (planned Mar 2025)
- **Building Improvement Special Duty Team** — proactive inspections of 1,800 old buildings annually (planned Q1 2025)
- **Emergency Alert System (EAS)** — cell broadcast-based, launched Nov 2020 ([news.gov.hk](https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/11/20201126/20201126_141856_671.html))

#### Critical gaps identified:
- **No publicly visible "lessons learned" process from international incidents** — Did FSD study Grenfell in 2017? If so, where is the report? What changes were made?
- **Meeting average targets may mask failures in specific high-risk cases** — 95.6% building fire response rate may hide failures at individual incidents (Jordan, Tai Po)
- **Enforcement lag** — Fire Safety Directions issued but not complied with for years (New Lucky House: Direction in 2008, fire in 2024)
- **Renovation fire safety oversight** was apparently inadequate before Tai Po — no effective regulation of combustible scaffolding/netting materials
- **No systematic comparison** with international best practices is publicly available
- **EAS is effectively dormant** — HK$150M system used only **once** (COVID-19, Mar 2022); NOT activated during the Level 5 Wang Fuk Court fire that killed 168 people; unclear who can trigger it for fires ([OFCA](https://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/consumer_focus/guide/help_for_consumers/emergency_alert_system/index.html))
- **Fire safety education is severely under-scaled** — only **324 talks** reaching **16,550 people** in 2024, in a city of 7.5 million; unclear if any training was conducted at Wang Fuk Court; 40% of residents were 65+ ([FSD Annual Review 2024](https://www.hkfsd.gov.hk/eng/education/fseu.html))
- **Manual fire alarm knowledge gap** — most residents don't know fire alarms in older buildings are **manual, not automatic**; residents at Wang Fuk Court failed to activate call points during the fire
- **Contractor fraud and oversight failure** — fire service installation contractors arrested for deactivating alarms and filing false reports; 16 inspections over 16 months failed to identify non-compliant materials (inspectors accepted ground-level samples only)
- **NFPA 8-element framework analysis** (applied by IFSJ) shows failures across ALL elements: government responsibility, codes, standards, investment, workforce, compliance, preparedness, and informed public

## Recommended Lines of Inquiry for Legco Report

### For Question 1 (Was Tai Po preventable / should FSD be blamed?):
1. Did FSD conduct a formal review after the London Grenfell fire (2017)? If so, produce the review report.
2. What specific policy/procedural changes were adopted in HK as a result of studying Grenfell?
3. Were renovation-site fire safety standards (scaffolding, netting, foam boards) reviewed or tightened after Grenfell?
4. Were residents' complaints about Wang Fuk Court renovation fire safety received by FSD? If so, what action was taken?
5. Were fire alarms at Wang Fuk Court tested or inspected by FSD before the fire?

### For Question 2 (How can FSD learn from past incidents going forward?):
1. What is FSD's formal process for studying international fire incidents and applying lessons to HK?
2. Which FSD unit is responsible for this "lessons learned" function?
3. Can FSD publish an annual "International Fire Lessons Review" report?
4. Can FSD adopt Mainland China's approach of proactive national inspections after major incidents?
5. Can FSD strengthen enforcement of Fire Safety Directions with real deadlines and penalties?
6. Can FSD improve the Emergency Alert System to be used proactively during fire emergencies?
