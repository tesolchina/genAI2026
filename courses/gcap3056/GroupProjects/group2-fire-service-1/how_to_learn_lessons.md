# How Can the FSD Learn Lessons from Past Fire Incidents?

**Project:** Group 2 — Fire Service 1  
**Focus:** The mechanism of FSD in learning from past fire incidents (abroad and in Mainland)  
**Date:** 12 Feb 2026

---

## Two Key Questions

### Question 1: Should the FSD be blamed for "failing" to learn from London Grenfell and other similar incidents before the Tai Po fire? Was the Tai Po fire preventable?

### Question 2: In what ways can FSD learn from past incidents (not limited to Tai Po fire) that might carry lessons to help prevent major fire incidents in HK in the future?

## Question 1: Was the Tai Po Fire Preventable?

### The Tai Po (Wang Fuk Court) Fire — Key Facts

- **Date:** 26 Nov 2025; **Location:** Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po
- **Death toll:** At least 159–160 people ([Reuters comparison](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-does-hong-kong-tower-fire-compare-other-recent-building-blazes-2025-11-28/))
- **Scale:** 7 of 8 31-storey towers engulfed; Hong Kong's deadliest blaze in nearly 8 decades
- **Cause:** External fire fuelled by combustible renovation materials — bamboo scaffolding and protective netting creating a "chimney effect" up the façade ([Caixin analysis](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2025-11-27/analysis-hong-kong-fire-exposed-fatal-gap-in-high-rise-safety-doctrine-102387561.html))
- **Contributing factors:**
  - Green protective mesh netting failed to meet flame-retardant standards
  - Highly flammable foam board used in renovation work
  - Non-functional fire alarms
  - Bamboo scaffolding and waterproof tarpaulins did not meet fire safety standards
  - HK$330 million renovation project dating back to 2016 ([HKFP timeline](https://hongkongfp.com/2025/12/17/tai-po-fire-timeline-wang-fuk-courts-hk330-million-renovation-ignored-warnings-and-aftermath/))
  - **Ignored safety complaints** filed by residents with authorities
  - Multiple government visits (including one a week before the fire) failed to prevent the tragedy

### What lessons from Grenfell were available BEFORE Tai Po?

The London Grenfell Tower fire (14 June 2017, 72 deaths) offered these lessons, all publicly available years before Tai Po:

- **Combustible cladding/external materials** were the primary cause of fire spread at Grenfell ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40301289))
  - The aluminium composite material (ACM) with polyethylene core melted, dripped, and flowed at elevated temperature
  - Vertical cavities within the cladding structure played a role in fire spread
  - The UK subsequently removed similar cladding from thousands of buildings
- **"Stay put" policy failed** when external fire spread made it impossible to contain fire to one flat ([London Museum](https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/grenfell-tower-fire/))
- **Fire alarms and smoke extraction systems failed** — smoke extraction was not working; no wet riser for water supply
- **Residents' complaints were ignored** — the Grenfell Action Group warned in 2016: *"Only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord"*
- **Substandard materials and inadequate supervision** — cladding had failed fire safety tests before installation; manufacturers hid findings
- **No evacuation plan** — firefighters were not prepared; no specific plan for evacuating the tower
- **TMO showed "persistent indifference"** to fire safety — inquiry found systemic failures in management

### Parallels between Grenfell and Tai Po

| Factor | Grenfell (2017) | Tai Po (2025) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| External combustible materials | ACM cladding with polyethylene core | Scaffolding nets, foam board, tarpaulins |
| "Chimney effect" / rapid spread | Fire spread via cladding cavities | Fire spread via scaffolding and netting |
| Residents' warnings ignored | Grenfell Action Group complaints | Safety complaints filed with authorities |
| Fire alarm failure | Smoke extraction not working | Non-functional fire alarms |
| Substandard materials | Failed fire safety tests | Did not meet flame-retardant standards |
| Renovation-related | 2010s cladding refurbishment | HK$330 million façade renovation |

### Assessment: Was FSD's failure to learn from Grenfell a factor?

- **The pattern was known:** External combustible materials on building façades causing rapid fire spread was a well-documented risk after Grenfell
- **The gap:** Hong Kong did not appear to have applied Grenfell's lessons to regulate combustible renovation materials (scaffolding nets, foam boards) on building façades during renovation works
- **The question for FSD:** Did the FSD study the Grenfell fire? If so, what specific policy or procedural changes were made? Did those changes address external façade fire risks during renovation works?
- **Note on accountability:** Hong Kong's swift response (arrests of contractor/consultancy executives) contrasts with Grenfell's 7+ year wait for prosecution ([China Daily](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/625217))

## Question 2: How Can FSD Learn from Past Incidents to Prevent Future Major Fires?

### A. Lessons from International Incidents

#### 1. London Grenfell Tower (2017) — UK
- **Key lesson:** Ban combustible cladding; retrofit existing buildings; enforce fire safety in renovations
- **What UK did:** Public inquiry → 1,700-page report (Sep 2024); removed similar cladding from thousands of buildings; new building safety regulations
- **What HK should learn:** Systematic review of all external materials on existing buildings; ban non-fire-retardant renovation materials
- **Source:** [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40301289) | [London Museum](https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/grenfell-tower-fire/)

#### 2. Mainland China — National Inspection Campaign (2025)
- **Key lesson:** Proactive, nationwide response to fire risks in high-rise buildings
- **What Mainland did after Tai Po:** Launched national inspection campaign on 29 Nov 2025 focusing on:
  - High-rise buildings undergoing external/internal wall renovations
  - Verification of prohibited materials (bamboo scaffolding, non-fire resistant safety nets)
  - Testing of fire hydrants, water sprinklers, and alarm systems
  - Prevention of maintenance failures in aging fire safety infrastructure
- **Context:** China's 2023 data showed 23,000 high-rise fires (35% increase from 2022); external insulation materials identified as major contributing factor
- **What HK should learn:** Regular, proactive fire safety inspections of renovation sites; not just reactive after incidents
- **Source:** [Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/concern-raised-in-china-over-fire-hazards-in-tall-buildings-after-deadly-hong-kong-fire)

#### 3. Global Lessons for High-Rise Safety
- **Key lesson:** External fire risk during renovation is a known global hazard
- **What HK should learn:** Adopt international standards for flame-retardant scaffolding materials; fire safety oversight of renovation works
- **Source:** [International Fire & Safety Journal](https://internationalfireandsafetyjournal.com/wang-fuk-court-fire-lessons/)

### B. Lessons from Local Incidents (Hong Kong)

#### 4. Jordan Fire — New Lucky House (Apr 2024)
- **Key lesson:** Old composite buildings with uncomplied Fire Safety Directions are ticking time bombs
- **What happened:** No. 3 alarm fire; 5 dead, 35 injured; 16-storey building (1964); Fire Safety Direction issued 2008 but not complied; 2023 repair tender still in preparation
- **FSD response:** Formed dedicated team; proactive inspections of ~1,000 old composite buildings; 8,661 notices issued; over half related to smoke stop door irregularities
- **Lesson for FSD:** Enforcement of Fire Safety Directions must have a real deadline and real consequences for non-compliance
- **Source:** [Info.gov.hk CE statement](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202404/10/P2024041000356.htm) | [BD inspection](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202404/11/P2024041100013.htm)

#### 5. FSD IT Data Breach (May 2024)
- **Key lesson:** FSD's internal IT systems are vulnerable; contractor oversight is weak
- **What happened:** Potential personal data leakage during contractor data migration; ~480 members of public + ~5,000 FSD members affected
- **Lesson for FSD:** Modernize IT systems; tighter contractor access controls; ensure alert/reporting systems are resilient
- **Source:** [Info.gov.hk](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202405/06/P2024050600687.htm) | [SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3261641/hong-kong-fire-service-reports-potential-leak-personal-data-5000-staff-members-public)

#### 6. Typhoon Saola Tree Collapse Reports (Sep 2023)
- **Key lesson:** FSD's public reporting and alert systems must cope with extreme events
- **What happened:** 1,545+ fallen trees; 86+ hospitalised; high volume of public reports to FSD
- **Lesson for FSD:** Stress-test reporting and alert systems for extreme events; ensure data systems can handle surges
- **Source:** [SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3233189/typhoon-saola-aftermath-hong-kong-wakes-debris-and-fallen-trees-roads-damage-not-bad-feared)

### C. FSD's Existing Mechanisms for Learning — and Gaps

#### What FSD currently does:
- **Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force** — led by FSD, includes Police, BD, EMSD, Housing Bureau, Labour Dept, Government Lab, fire engineers ([news.gov.hk](https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2025/11/20251129/20251129_143248_032.html))
- **Performance Pledge** — building fire response: 6 min (92.5% target; 95.6% achieved 2024) ([FSD Performance Pledge](https://www.hkfsd.gov.hk/eng/aboutus/performance.html))
- **Year-end Review** — annual public review of performance metrics ([Year-end Review 2024](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202501/22/P2025012200234p.htm))
- **Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance** — amended Dec 2024 with defaulted works mechanism and increased penalties
- **One-stop Coordination Office** for new fire protection facilities (planned Mar 2025)
- **Building Improvement Special Duty Team** — proactive inspections of 1,800 old buildings annually (planned Q1 2025)
- **Emergency Alert System (EAS)** — cell broadcast-based, launched Nov 2020 ([news.gov.hk](https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/11/20201126/20201126_141856_671.html))

#### Critical gaps identified:
- **No publicly visible "lessons learned" process from international incidents** — Did FSD study Grenfell in 2017? If so, where is the report? What changes were made?
- **Meeting average targets may mask failures in specific high-risk cases** — 95.6% building fire response rate may hide failures at individual incidents (Jordan, Tai Po)
- **Enforcement lag** — Fire Safety Directions issued but not complied with for years (New Lucky House: Direction in 2008, fire in 2024)
- **Renovation fire safety oversight** was apparently inadequate before Tai Po — no effective regulation of combustible scaffolding/netting materials
- **No systematic comparison** with international best practices is publicly available
- **EAS effectiveness questionable** — described as "white elephant" in SCMP letters; unclear if used during major fires

## Recommended Lines of Inquiry for Legco Report

### For Question 1 (Was Tai Po preventable / should FSD be blamed?):
1. Did FSD conduct a formal review after the London Grenfell fire (2017)? If so, produce the review report.
2. What specific policy/procedural changes were adopted in HK as a result of studying Grenfell?
3. Were renovation-site fire safety standards (scaffolding, netting, foam boards) reviewed or tightened after Grenfell?
4. Were residents' complaints about Wang Fuk Court renovation fire safety received by FSD? If so, what action was taken?
5. Were fire alarms at Wang Fuk Court tested or inspected by FSD before the fire?

### For Question 2 (How can FSD learn from past incidents going forward?):
1. What is FSD's formal process for studying international fire incidents and applying lessons to HK?
2. Which FSD unit is responsible for this "lessons learned" function?
3. Can FSD publish an annual "International Fire Lessons Review" report?
4. Can FSD adopt Mainland China's approach of proactive national inspections after major incidents?
5. Can FSD strengthen enforcement of Fire Safety Directions with real deadlines and penalties?
6. Can FSD improve the Emergency Alert System to be used proactively during fire emergencies?
