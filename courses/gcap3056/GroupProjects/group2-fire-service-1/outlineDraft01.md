## Title
**Burning Lessons Unlearned: Has Hong Kong's Fire Services Department Adequately Applied Lessons from Major Fires?**

---

## Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- **Core argument:** Despite major fire incidents both locally and internationally — including the London Grenfell Tower fire (2017, 72 deaths) and the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire (2025, 160+ deaths) — evidence suggests the Fire Services Department (FSD) may not have systematically learned from past incidents and applied those lessons to prevent future tragedies in Hong Kong.
- **Key finding (expected):** No publicly available evidence that FSD conducted a formal review of the Grenfell fire and implemented specific changes to address external façade fire risks during building renovation works — a direct parallel to the Tai Po fire.
- **Recommendation (preview):** Establish a formal, publicly accountable "Lessons Learned" mechanism within FSD, with mandatory review of major international fire incidents and published reports on policy changes adopted.

## 1. Background: The Problem

### 1.1 Hong Kong's Recent Major Fire Incidents
- **Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po** (26 Nov 2025) — 160+ deaths; 7 of 8 towers engulfed; external fire fuelled by combustible renovation materials (scaffolding nets, foam boards, non-fire-retardant tarpaulins); fire alarms non-functional; residents' complaints ignored
  - [Reuters: How does Hong Kong tower fire compare](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-does-hong-kong-tower-fire-compare-other-recent-building-blazes-2025-11-28/)
  - [HKFP: Tai Po fire timeline](https://hongkongfp.com/2025/12/17/tai-po-fire-timeline-wang-fuk-courts-hk330-million-renovation-ignored-warnings-and-aftermath/)
  - [SCMP: What are the right lessons](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3334643/what-are-right-lessons-hong-kongs-worst-fire-7-decades)
- **New Lucky House, Jordan** (Apr 2024) — 5 dead, 35 injured; 16-storey building (1964); Fire Safety Direction issued 2008 but uncomplied; smoke stop doors deficient
  - [CE statement](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202404/10/P2024041000356.htm)
  - [BD inspection report](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202404/11/P2024041100013.htm)

### 1.2 International Parallels: London Grenfell Tower (2017)
- 72 deaths; combustible ACM cladding with polyethylene core was primary cause of fire spread
- "Stay put" policy failed; fire alarms and smoke extraction failed; no evacuation plan
- Residents' complaints ignored (Grenfell Action Group warned in 2016)
- UK launched public inquiry → 1,700-page report (Sep 2024); removed similar cladding from thousands of buildings
- **Key question:** Did HK's FSD study this fire and apply lessons?

  - [London Museum: The Grenfell Tower Fire](https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/grenfell-tower-fire/)

### 1.3 Mainland China's Response
- After Tai Po fire, Mainland launched national inspection campaign (29 Nov 2025) targeting high-rise renovation fire safety
- China's 2023 data: 23,000 high-rise fires (35% increase from 2022)
  - [Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/concern-raised-in-china-over-fire-hazards-in-tall-buildings-after-deadly-hong-kong-fire)

### 1.4 Other Systemic Issues
- FSD IT data breach (May 2024): potential leakage of ~5,000 staff + ~480 public members' data during contractor migration — raises questions about internal systems resilience
  - [Info.gov.hk](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202405/06/P2024050600687.htm)
- Emergency Alert System described as "white elephant" (SCMP letters) — unclear if ever used during fire emergencies

## 2. Existing Solution: What FSD Currently Does

### 2.1 Response and Performance
- **Performance Pledge:** Building fire response within 6 min (target 92.5%; achieved 95.6% in 2024)
  - [FSD Performance Pledge](https://www.hkfsd.gov.hk/eng/aboutus/performance.html)
  - [FSD Year-end Review 2024](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202501/22/P2025012200234p.htm)

### 2.2 Fire Safety Regulation
- **Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance** — amended and in force Dec 2024; defaulted works mechanism; increased penalties
- **One-stop Coordination Office** for new fire protection facilities (planned Mar 2025)
- **Building Improvement Special Duty Team** — proactive inspections of 1,800 old buildings annually (planned Q1 2025)

### 2.3 Investigation and Review
- **Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force** — led by FSD; includes Police, BD, EMSD, Housing Bureau, Labour Dept, Government Lab
  - [Task force probes Tai Po fire](https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2025/11/20251129/20251129_143248_032.html)
- **Emergency Alert System (EAS)** — cell broadcast-based, launched Nov 2020

## 3. Room for Improvement: Our Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1 (primary)
**The FSD did not adequately learn from the London Grenfell fire (2017) and other international incidents — specific safety measures that could have been adopted were not implemented, contributing to the conditions that made the Tai Po fire deadly.**

Supporting evidence:
- Combustible external materials on building façades was a known risk after Grenfell
- HK did not appear to regulate combustible renovation materials (scaffolding nets, foam boards) before Tai Po
- No publicly available FSD report on lessons learned from Grenfell
- Residents' complaints about Wang Fuk Court were reportedly ignored — same pattern as Grenfell

### Hypothesis 2 (secondary)
**The FSD lacks a formal, publicly accountable mechanism for learning from past fire incidents — both local and international — and translating those lessons into policy and enforcement improvements.**

Supporting evidence:
- No published "lessons learned" reports from international incidents
- Meeting average performance targets (95.6%) may mask failures in specific high-risk cases
- Enforcement of Fire Safety Directions has severe lag (New Lucky House: Direction 2008, fire 2024)
- EAS effectiveness is questionable and may not have been used during major fires

### Questions to Explore
- Which FSD unit is responsible for studying past fire incidents and applying lessons?
- What specific changes were made after the London Grenfell fire?
- How were residents alerted during the 2025 Tai Po fire?
- What is the FSD's process for reviewing and learning from past incidents?
- How does Mainland China's national inspection approach compare to HK's?

## 4. Government's Replies to Our Enquiries

### 4.1 Questions to be sent (under Code on Access to Information)

*See `govEnquiry.md` for full list of questions.*

**Priority questions:**
1. Did FSD conduct a formal review after the London Grenfell fire (2017)? If so, produce the review report.
2. What specific policy or procedural changes resulted from studying the Grenfell fire?
3. What is the FSD's formal process for studying international fire incidents and applying lessons to HK?
4. Which FSD unit is responsible for the "lessons learned" function?
5. Were residents' complaints about Wang Fuk Court renovation fire safety received by FSD? What action was taken?
6. Were fire alarms at Wang Fuk Court tested or inspected by FSD before the fire?
7. Was the Emergency Alert System (EAS) activated during the Tai Po fire?

### 4.2 Anticipated Replies and How to Use Them

| If government says... | Our follow-up |
|----------------------|---------------|
| "We reviewed Grenfell internally" | Request the review report under Code on Access to Information |
| "No formal review was conducted" | Argue this is a systemic failure; recommend mandatory review mechanism |
| "Changes were made but not publicly documented" | Argue for transparency; compare with UK's public inquiry model |
| "The Tai Po fire had different causes from Grenfell" | Point out the parallel of combustible external materials and ignored complaints |
| "EAS was not designed for fire emergencies" | Argue it should be; compare with Mainland's proactive alert approach |

---

## 5. Complaints and Follow-up

- If FSD cannot demonstrate systematic learning from past incidents → recommend that LegCo push for a formal, publicly accountable "International Fire Lessons Review" mechanism
- If Fire Safety Directions are not enforced → recommend strict deadlines with real consequences
- If EAS is not used during fires → recommend expanding EAS scope to cover fire emergencies
- If renovation fire safety was inadequate → recommend mandatory flame-retardant standards for all renovation materials with on-site inspection

---

## 6. Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage

- **Main angle:** "What did Hong Kong learn from London's Grenfell Tower fire?" — compare policy changes in UK vs HK after major fires; highlight the 8-year gap between Grenfell (2017) and Tai Po (2025)
- **Supporting angle:** "Were the warning signs ignored?" — residents' complaints at both Grenfell and Wang Fuk Court
- **Mainland comparison:** How China responded within days of Tai Po with a national inspection campaign, while HK had not proactively inspected renovation sites
- **Letter to editor (SCMP):** Fire safety accountability and the need for a public "lessons learned" process
- **Data journalism:** Map all major fire incidents in HK (past 10 years) alongside Fire Safety Direction compliance rates and enforcement timelines
