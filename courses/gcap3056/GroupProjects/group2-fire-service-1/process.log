---

## 12 Feb 2026 — Major Update (AI-assisted)

### What was done:

1. **Fetched Google Doc content → created `GoogleNotes.md`**
   - Source: [Group 2 Fire services Public info curation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n3a_qLQHx7iNMYk5KR4-0v5rFqml2l_B9IhbS7Cvgi4/edit?tab=t.0)
   - Tab 1: Two detailed entries on Grenfell Tower fire (by Yang Yunxuan and Zhang Chenghao) with facts, comments, and full texts
   - Tab 2 (Legco report): Draft report outline (same as outlineDraft.md)
   - Aligned with Google Doc structure

2. **Reviewed all notes → created `how_to_learn_lessons.md`**
   - Reviewed: `GoogleNotes.md`, `WebSearchReport.md`, `public-info.md`, `outlineDraft.md`, `Followup5Feb.md`, `planNextSteps.md`, `seekFeedback.md`
   - Web research on: Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire (Nov 2025), FSD investigation response, Mainland China national inspection campaign, international fire safety lessons
   - Addressed two key questions:
     - Q1: Should FSD be blamed for failing to learn from Grenfell? Was Tai Po preventable?
     - Q2: How can FSD learn from past incidents to prevent future major fires?
   - Includes Grenfell–Tai Po comparison table, FSD's existing mechanisms and gaps, recommended lines of inquiry

3. **Created `outlineDraft01.md`** (updated Legco report outline)
   - Based on original `outlineDraft.md`
   - Major additions: Tai Po fire context (160+ deaths), Grenfell parallels, Mainland China response, two refined hypotheses, anticipated government replies table, expanded media coverage suggestions, comprehensive clickable references

4. **Created `govEnquiry.md`**
   - 27 specific questions organised into 5 parts:
     - Part A: Learning from international incidents (Grenfell)
     - Part B: Tai Po fire-specific questions
     - Part C: FSD enforcement and accountability
     - Part D: Emergency Alert System
     - Part E: Forward-looking / prevention
   - Includes submission instructions (Code on Access to Information, LegCo Redress, direct enquiry)

5. **Created `process.log`** (this file)

## 5 Feb 2026 — Follow-up Session

- Created `Followup5Feb.md` with action items in 3 phases:
  - Phase 1: Research past incidents and lessons learned
  - Phase 2: Identify responsible units within FSD
  - Phase 3: Policy recommendations
- Identified need to find FSD organisational chart and specific units

---

## Earlier sessions (pre-5 Feb)

- Created `public-info.md` — project overview and direction
- Created `WebSearchReport.md` — 5 rounds of AI web search (FSD IT incident, EAS, Jordan fire, Typhoon Saola, performance pledge)
- Created `planNextSteps.md` — workflow plan modelled on group6-rare-disease
- Created `seekFeedback.md` — request for team and teacher feedback
- Created `outlineDraft.md` — initial Legco report outline

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Students to review `how_to_learn_lessons.md` and `outlineDraft01.md` — add comments, refine hypotheses
- [ ] Students to review `govEnquiry.md` — select which questions to submit first
- [ ] Decide on submission channel: Code on Access to Information vs direct enquiry vs LegCo
- [ ] Update Google Doc with new findings
- [ ] Teacher feedback on hypotheses and report structure
- [ ] Conduct additional web research if needed (e.g., FSD organisational chart, specific international incidents)
- [ ] Begin drafting the full Legco report based on `outlineDraft01.md`
