## Purpose

To gather information that is **not publicly available** about FSD's mechanism for learning from past fire incidents (local and international), and to assess whether the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire (Nov 2025) could have been prevented had lessons from the London Grenfell fire (2017) and other incidents been properly applied.

---

## Part A: Learning from International Incidents (Grenfell and Others)

### A1. To the Fire Services Department

1. **Did the FSD conduct a formal review or study of the London Grenfell Tower fire (14 June 2017) after it occurred?**
   - If yes, please provide a copy of or reference to the review report.
   - If no, please explain why not, given the Grenfell fire's relevance to high-rise fire safety in Hong Kong.

2. **What specific policy, procedural, or regulatory changes were adopted in Hong Kong as a result of studying the Grenfell fire?**
   - Please list each change, the date it was adopted, and the FSD unit responsible for implementation.

3. **Which FSD unit or division is responsible for studying international fire incidents and translating lessons into local policy?**
   - Please provide the unit name, its position in the FSD organisational structure, and its terms of reference.

4. **Does the FSD have a formal "lessons learned" process or mechanism for reviewing major fire incidents (both local and international)?**
   - If yes, please describe the process: how incidents are selected for review, who conducts the review, what outputs are produced, and how recommendations are followed up.
   - If no, please explain how the FSD ensures that lessons from past incidents are applied to prevent future ones.

5. **Has the FSD studied any other major international fire incidents in the past 10 years (e.g., Grenfell 2017, South Korea Jecheon sports centre fire 2017, Dhaka factory fires, Mainland China high-rise fires)?**
   - If yes, please list the incidents studied and the resulting changes.
   - If no, please explain why not.

6. **Following the Wang Fuk Court fire (Nov 2025), has the FSD initiated a review of its mechanism for learning from past incidents? If so, what changes are being considered?**

### A2. To the Security Bureau

7. **Does the Security Bureau have a policy requiring the FSD (or other disciplined services) to conduct formal reviews of major international incidents relevant to their work?**
   - If yes, please describe the policy and how compliance is monitored.
   - If no, would the Bureau consider establishing such a policy?

9. **Were fire alarms at Wang Fuk Court tested or inspected by the FSD in the 12 months before the fire?**
   - If yes, when was the last inspection, and what was the result?
   - If no, why not — given the ongoing renovation work?

10. **Did the FSD inspect or review the fire safety arrangements at Wang Fuk Court specifically in relation to the renovation works (scaffolding, netting, foam boards)?**
    - If yes, when, and what were the findings?
    - If no, whose responsibility was it to ensure fire safety during renovation?

11. **Were the protective nets, tarpaulins, and foam boards used at Wang Fuk Court required to meet flame-retardant standards at the time of the fire?**
    - If yes, were they tested and certified? By whom?
    - If no, why not — and has this been changed since?

### B2. Emergency Response

12. **Was the Emergency Alert System (EAS) activated during the Wang Fuk Court fire?**
    - If yes, at what time, and what message was sent?
    - If no, why not — and what criteria must be met for EAS activation during a fire?

13. **What was the FSD's response timeline for the Wang Fuk Court fire?**
    - Time of first 999 call, time of first unit arrival, time of escalation to higher alarms, time of EAS activation (if any).

---

## Part C: FSD Enforcement and Accountability

### C1. Fire Safety Directions and Compliance

14. **How many Fire Safety Directions (under the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance) are currently outstanding (i.e., issued but not yet complied with)?**
    - Please provide a breakdown by year of issuance and by district.

15. **What is the average time between issuance of a Fire Safety Direction and full compliance?**
    - Please provide data for the past 5 years.

16. **In the case of New Lucky House (Jordan fire, Apr 2024), a Fire Safety Direction was issued in 2008 but was not complied with by the time of the fire in 2024. What enforcement action was taken during those 16 years?**
    - Why was compliance not achieved in 16 years?

17. **Under the amended Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance (in force Dec 2024), what are the new penalties for non-compliance with Fire Safety Directions? How many enforcement actions have been taken under the new provisions?**

### C2. Renovation Site Fire Safety

18. **Before the Wang Fuk Court fire, were there any regulations or guidelines specifically governing fire safety at building renovation sites (e.g., scaffolding, netting, temporary structures)?**
    - If yes, please provide references.
    - If no, has this gap now been addressed?

19. **Since the Wang Fuk Court fire, what new regulations or guidelines have been issued for fire safety at renovation sites?**

24. **What are the protocols for temporarily deactivating fire alarm systems during building renovation? Who must be notified and what safeguards (e.g., fire watches, temporary alarms) must be in place?**

25. **Under the Fire Services Ordinance, must a contractor file a "Fire Service Installation Shutdown Notice" with FSD when deactivating alarm systems? How many such notices were filed for Wang Fuk Court renovation?**

26. **How does FSD verify the accuracy of FS251 certificates (annual fire service installation inspection certificates)? Are spot checks conducted, or does FSD rely on contractor self-reporting?**

33. **How does FSD measure the effectiveness of its fire safety education programmes? What metrics are used? Are there any outcome evaluations showing improved resident preparedness?**

34. **Do FSD education programmes teach residents how to activate manual fire alarm call points? Given that video evidence showed Wang Fuk Court residents trying unsuccessfully to use call points, is this a recognized gap?**

35. **Are there specific training modules for residents or property management staff on fire safety during building renovation works (when fire systems may be impaired)?**

## Part G: Forward-Looking — Preventing Future Incidents

36. **Will the FSD consider publishing an annual "International Fire Lessons Review" report — studying major fire incidents worldwide and identifying lessons applicable to Hong Kong?**

37. **Will the FSD adopt Mainland China's approach of launching proactive national inspections of specific building types after major incidents (as done after the Wang Fuk Court fire)?**

38. **Will the FSD consider establishing a dedicated "Lessons Learned Unit" or assigning this function explicitly to an existing unit, with published terms of reference?**
