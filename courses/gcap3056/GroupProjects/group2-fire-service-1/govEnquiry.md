## Purpose

To gather information that is **not publicly available** about FSD's mechanism for learning from past fire incidents (local and international), and to assess whether the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire (Nov 2025) could have been prevented had lessons from the London Grenfell fire (2017) and other incidents been properly applied.

## Part A: Learning from International Incidents (Grenfell and Others)

### A1. To the Fire Services Department

   - If yes, please provide a copy of or reference to the review report.
   - If no, please explain why not, given the Grenfell fire's relevance to high-rise fire safety in Hong Kong.

2. **What specific policy, procedural, or regulatory changes were adopted in Hong Kong as a result of studying the Grenfell fire?**
   - Please list each change, the date it was adopted, and the FSD unit responsible for implementation.

3. **Which FSD unit or division is responsible for studying international fire incidents and translating lessons into local policy?**
   - Please provide the unit name, its position in the FSD organisational structure, and its terms of reference.

4. **Does the FSD have a formal "lessons learned" process or mechanism for reviewing major fire incidents (both local and international)?**
   - If yes, please describe the process: how incidents are selected for review, who conducts the review, what outputs are produced, and how recommendations are followed up.
   - If no, please explain how the FSD ensures that lessons from past incidents are applied to prevent future ones.

5. **Has the FSD studied any other major international fire incidents in the past 10 years (e.g., Grenfell 2017, South Korea Jecheon sports centre fire 2017, Dhaka factory fires, Mainland China high-rise fires)?**
   - If yes, please list the incidents studied and the resulting changes.
   - If no, please explain why not.

6. **Following the Wang Fuk Court fire (Nov 2025), has the FSD initiated a review of its mechanism for learning from past incidents? If so, what changes are being considered?**

### A2. To the Security Bureau

7. **Does the Security Bureau have a policy requiring the FSD (or other disciplined services) to conduct formal reviews of major international incidents relevant to their work?**
   - If yes, please describe the policy and how compliance is monitored.
