**Fact 1:**
Grenfell Tower had a 'stay put' fire policy — essentially, the building design would contain a fire in a single flat for as long as it took fire crews to bring it under control.

**Comment 1 (on Fact 1):**
People are ordered to stay at home. When the fire is out of control, the fire blazed out of control and thick poisonous smoke spread up the single narrow stairwell. People need to do different choices according to different circumstances. The government should improve their policies.

**Fact 2:**
Giving evidence to the inquiry, Dr Lane said exposed gas pipes installed in 2016 were another contributory factor, while none of the flat doors met current fire resistance standards.

**Comment 1 (on Fact 2):**
The substandard quality of materials used had a huge impact on the occurrence and spread of this fire, which also revealed the government's inadequate supervision over the materials used in construction. The government should improve its supervision system.

**Full texts (excerpts):**
- Grenfell Tower had a 'stay put' fire policy — essentially, the building design would contain a fire in a single flat for as long as it took fire crews to bring it under control.
- So on the night, many residents were told to remain in their flats by the emergency services, only to become trapped as the fire blazed out of control and thick poisonous smoke spread up the single narrow stairwell.
- Dr Lane said that the stay put policy had "substantially failed" by 01:26 — less than 30 minutes after the first firefighters were at the scene.
- Some people ignored the stay put advice and made it down the stairs to safety.
- The most significant part of the renovation of Grenfell Tower was the addition of external cladding. This consisted of aluminium sheets bonded to a central plastic (polyethylene) core.
- In his report to the public inquiry, Professor Luke Bisby said evidence "strongly supports" the theory that the polyethylene material in the cladding was the primary cause of the fire's spread.
- "The ACM (aluminium composite material) product on Grenfell Tower incorporates a highly combustible polyethylene polymer filler which melts, drips, and flows at elevated temperature."
- Vertical cavities within the cladding structure played a role in the spread of the fire, as did the insulation (evidence inconclusive).
- A number of other flammable materials, including a polyurethane polymer foam insulation board which pre-dated the refurbishment, were also present and may have contributed.
- Fire expert Dr Barbara Lane identifies combustible materials used in the refurbishment of the tower's windows as another factor in allowing the fire to spread.
- The Grenfell Inquiry heard that the building's smoke extraction system was not working, and that firefighters experienced problems with the water supply because there was no 'wet riser'.
- Exposed gas pipes installed in 2016 were another contributory factor, while none of the flat doors met current fire resistance standards.

### Entry 2: THE GRENFELL TOWER FIRE

| **Title** | THE GRENFELL TOWER FIRE |
| **Contributor** | ZHANG Chenghao |
| **URL** | [https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/grenfell-tower-fire/](https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/grenfell-tower-fire/) |

**Fact 1:**
In the decades since, many tower blocks have been neglected, with cuts made to the necessary care and repair of the buildings. In the case of Grenfell, residents regularly complained about problems with fire safety but were ignored.

**Comment 1 (on Fact 1):**
This sentence highlights a critical, systemic failure that goes far beyond one building. It shows how long-term underinvestment in maintenance and ignoring resident concerns created a disaster waiting to happen. Fire safety was not an afterthought — it was actively overlooked, even when warnings were given.

**Fact 2:**
Until 2:47am, they advised residents to "stay put" in their flats. The Grenfell Tower inquiry found that this advice should have changed an hour earlier, when it was clear that the fire had spread. The inquiry found that firefighters were not properly prepared by their bosses for the situation they faced. There was no specific plan for evacuating Grenfell Tower. Vulnerable and disabled residents were not adequately accounted for.

**Comment 1 (on Fact 2):**
This passage reveals serious failures in emergency response and planning during the Grenfell Tower fire. The delayed change from the "stay put" strategy cost vital time, showing that fire officials failed to recognize how quickly the fire was spreading. The inquiry's findings also expose a lack of preparedness and planning for evacuation. Together, these mistakes turned a dangerous fire into a tragedy, highlighting how inadequate emergency planning and slow decision-making can have devastating, life-threatening results.

**Full texts (excerpts by section):**

#### 21st-century injustice
- The effects of the Grenfell Tower fire didn't stop with those who lost their lives or their homes. It affected anyone who'd ever lived in a tower block.
- It was clear that residents weren't as safe as they should have been. They'd complained beforehand.
- An inquiry later found that flammable cladding, installed in the 2010s, was the main reason the fire had spread. The inquiry blamed failures by central and local government and dishonesty by the cladding manufacturers.
- "THE FIRE BROUGHT OUR CITY'S INEQUALITIES INTO SHARP FOCUS"
- Grenfell Tower is in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea — home to some of London's wealthiest streets, and a striking contrast in income, health and housing.

#### Who lived in Grenfell Tower?
- Among Grenfell's residents, there were people of all ages — from six months to 84. There were taxi drivers, a marketing manager, a painter-decorator, a waiter and nursery workers.
- It was a brilliantly multicultural building, where people born in London lived alongside those who'd come here in search of opportunities or safety.

#### When was Grenfell Tower built?
- Grenfell Tower was built in the 1970s as part of the Lancaster West housing estate in North Kensington, west London.
- Tower blocks sprouted across London in the 1960s and 1970s to replace slums with social housing.
- In the decades since, many tower blocks have been neglected, with cuts made to the necessary care and repair of the buildings.
- *"ONLY A CATASTROPHIC EVENT WILL EXPOSE THE INEPTITUDE AND INCOMPETENCE OF OUR LANDLORD"* — Grenfell Action Group, 2016

#### How did the fire start and spread?
- The Grenfell fire was started by an electrical fault in a fridge-freezer in one of the fourth-floor flats.
- Cladding attached to the outside of the building set alight, spreading the fire between floors.
- The fire was first reported by a 999 call just before 1am. The fire reached the roof half an hour later, and by 4am, covered the entire building.

#### How did firefighters respond?
- The first firefighters reached the tower five minutes after the 999 call. They rescued 65 people, while over a hundred escaped themselves.
- Until 2:47am, they advised residents to "stay put" in their flats. The Grenfell Tower inquiry found that this advice should have changed an hour earlier.
- The inquiry found that firefighters were not properly prepared by their bosses for the situation they faced. There was no specific plan for evacuating Grenfell Tower.

#### The cladding
- In the 2010s, aluminium and plastic panels had been attached to the 1970s tower block. This cladding helped the fire spread.
- The council claimed the cladding was installed to make the building warmer and drier. But some suggest the council only wanted to make the building look nicer.
- The cladding design had failed fire safety tests before it was installed at Grenfell. The manufacturers knew this, but hid the findings, lied about their products and denied responsibility.
- Thousands of buildings around Britain had similar cladding and after Grenfell, had to remove it.

#### Who managed Grenfell Tower?
- Grenfell was managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (TMO), on behalf of the borough council.
- The council have been accused of failing to invest in the care of the building. The unsafe cladding chosen for Grenfell's refurbishment was a cheaper option.
- The inquiry found that the TMO showed "persistent indifference" to fire safety at Grenfell. Before the fire, residents were already worried about fire safety. But they were ignored.

### Draft Report Outline: Fire Services — Learning from Past Incidents

#### Title (placeholder)
- Burning Lessons Unlearned: Has Hong Kong's Fire Services Department Adequately Applied Lessons from Major Fires?

#### Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- Key point: despite major fire incidents (Hong Kong tower fire, parallels to London Grenfell), evidence suggests the Fire Services Department may not have systematically learned from past incidents

#### Background: The Problem
- Hong Kong has experienced several significant fire incidents:
  - Jordan fire (New Lucky House)
  - 2025 Tai Po/Hong Kong tower fire ([Reuters comparison](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-does-hong-kong-tower-fire-compare-other-recent-building-blazes-2025-11-28/))
  - Parallels to London Grenfell Tower fire
- The FSD had an IT data breach incident in 2024, raising questions about internal systems
- Emergency Alert System was described as a "white elephant" in SCMP letters
- Reference: `WebSearchReport.md` (5 rounds on FSD incidents, alert systems, Typhoon Saola)

#### Existing Solution
- FSD performance pledge on response times
- Emergency Alert System for public notifications
- Internal review processes after major incidents
- Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance

#### Room for Improvement
- **Hypothesis 1:** The FSD did not learn enough from the London Grenfell fire — specific safety measures that could have been adopted were not implemented
- **Hypothesis 2:** The emergency alert system used during fires (notification to residents) needs improvement
- **Questions to explore:**
  - Which FSD unit is responsible for studying past fire incidents and applying lessons?
  - What specific changes were made after the London Grenfell fire?
  - How were residents alerted during the 2025 Hong Kong tower fire?
  - What is the FSD's process for reviewing and learning from past incidents?

#### Government's Replies to Our Enquiries
- [Placeholder — questions to be sent under Code on Access to Information]
- Suggested questions:
  - What review process did the FSD conduct after the London Grenfell fire?
  - What specific policy or procedural changes resulted from that review?
  - How does the FSD's "lessons learned" process work in practice?
  - What is the accountability structure for fire safety improvements?

#### Complaints and Follow-up
- [Placeholder — to be developed based on government replies]
- If the FSD cannot demonstrate systematic learning from past incidents, lawmakers should push for a formal review mechanism

#### Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage
- Angle: "What did Hong Kong learn from London's Grenfell Tower fire?" — compare policy changes in UK vs HK after major fires
- Potential letter to the editor (SCMP) on fire safety accountability
